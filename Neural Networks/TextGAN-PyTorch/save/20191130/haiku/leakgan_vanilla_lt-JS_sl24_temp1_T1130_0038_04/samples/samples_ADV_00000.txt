i hug the taste of + her eyes 's face
farewell embrace + a cloud + blue flakes + in the sky
blizzard lights . . . + under the changing
high tide + we let the quilts + still sea
chilly date -- - + the window + still cradle
harvest moon + a clear again + of distant air
computer crash ... + with the first plum + a swan 's whiteness
autumn cup + another antlers + still with snow
desert wind + the sun lights come from the thick + while your wait night good indoors
dusky clouds -- + the church + in the avalanche zone
wildfire blossom snow + a forgotten too fire + penetrates tense
a spring cloudless cranes , + the smell of newspaper
drifting field + the church 's steps + to painted + to wish
science day + the programme begins on + the brick
half-light + a carnelian moth touch + the lingering wall light
steady rain + the morning bright fence + the bug light
under the sun + the scent of leaves + on the fridge
season of mists . . . + a windshield in the sky
cold rain- + rain than the back + her cell before water
autumn mist + a pigeon + to study the hall
monday in the sky + i already miss the direction
valentine 's day + the heat fills the gold wrinkles
a moment the heat + a spent house + kept shines for heaven
hiroshima skies . . + a young tiny year empty face on scatter
after the storm - + a touch red + first cup
a few leaf + makes the heart + yellow to kill
hot break ... + a hawk tastes + the beans of a loon
after the storm and mixed + a homeless veteran 's + again itself
noon fog -- - + my witch passes + better fills stone
inching on her tents + in the way to the coffee
old love letter + back at the axe building + of her talk
all silence + the little salesman 's + electric sunset
