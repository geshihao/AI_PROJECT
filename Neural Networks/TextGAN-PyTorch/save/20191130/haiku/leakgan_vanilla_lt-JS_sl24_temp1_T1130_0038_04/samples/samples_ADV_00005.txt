the cold morning + becoming at his feet + the old 's voice
new haiga + the sound of daffodils + in the cat 's eyes
a boy memory of barking + high brothers
dusk -- + my windshield night + still in the red white scent
morning tai chi ~ + deep an alien breeze
sleeping moon + and light and the music + in the waning moon
gibbous moon -- + awakened another flakes + the mail plane as + also deserted
cold corn late - + my drop of a full moon
twilight sunset + my fallen knocks + to me to the valley
christmas day + i direct a patch + from my little bark + to water to list tombstones
wanting to embrace + no dirty fading + my line
winter solstice + the sun on the last sunflowers -- + lovers much over
butterfly + my attention + attention span
pinned butterfly , the swallows + with school lights
still snow - + monks between better + in their star
canyon : + at blossom you + at the shopping cart + at the park is love shade
secrets -- show + the shape of the walls bitter + left out overnight
ash wednesday -- + trying to remember + where a shadow
rainy day + after the marked + by wildflowers
after the child - + a nearly left + at its voice
all light + on a foggy breeze + the bar rose
to lead the walls + wait on the cake + lingers for a cloud
traffic jam - + nothing obscured + by dog 's shadow + along the soil
while those much closer + who damage + in a end of the tunnel
wood knot + fallen by twilight + in the winter graffiti
good fan + the nurse kite sets + of the sparrow 's light
invasive species + white barber tells me + away a lift
spring fever -- - + a homeless lady softly + spring laundromat + at their smile
trains approaching daisy + bursts and rain- + calf
harvest moon gleaners + pale faces , leaden mary , + back behind in the dawn
wolf butterfly + surging on the winter + first snow
end of summer + we friends come ... + a little sunflowers - + i have `` seen ''
