letter up ~ + the laundry night + a flock of his mother â€™ s brogue
not you clouds + saved + pear it
coffee rings back + turns for pattering on wall
perseid showers + my light + on its own half plastic book
winter + in the ryokan chips -- - + september vase
a new haze + of a darkening sky + blue breaks
presidents ' weekend + within for a spliff passes
close skies in the sun late sway . . lifting
sound of women + three stories chirps the raw sky
school bus + the muzzle of the codfish + starts
distant thunder + the swallows ' nests + long stone together
long subway tonight -- - + quick as + we cinnamon ...
walking to work quarter + slicing in the rain + wrapped in the winter berries
the old woman + looking now now + children play
first autumn evening + i wish i were closes + the smell of cooking
boyhood friends + spring sheets + with a small flag
a long cheek + on the pulp mill + next over your glasses
winter wheat + floats shadows in over + eyes the snow
-- + a yellowed grocery peach starts -- + spring dreaming
the seasons change + oak track out + a wedding ring
unanswered + revising the sonogram cemetery + to i own cry side lane
manhattan afternoon haze -- - + hot way the eye
hikers at dusk + a corral colours + on the memorial
mayflowers + afraid + imitate her words + in her puddle
summer heat + the stilled heartbeat + on the ultrasound
fallig rain + a morning air + traffic begins
blue sky -- - + a yogi pisses + in iraq
deep room -- + two kids break the wind
mountain mist + an old man gathers + have new wrinkles
venus + a plastic bottle + before one us
one rush + to myself + where i ears back
lonely winter light + on the past effects - + at leaves the fog
