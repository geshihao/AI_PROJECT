the evening green + opens to the incense + of a man 's grave
waiting for the cobb— + my bus fingernails reads + on her steps
dawn -- - + butt appears + in the graffiti
after each haiku— + the traffic voices + august as
hazy night + the darkness + its friends pots
october afternoon -- - + the bulbul 's trills + so clear
apples cooking : + on the branch to the diamonds
autumn rose— + sway women as if fleas now down lone + fractured lighten trees
a single leaf dried with day + the lipstick
birding . . + the phone friend 's cranes + the perfect chair
a only . + remembering + the orphaned details
winter graffiti -- - + the end ivy + brightly
uprooted clouds : + lily sand warmth + in the smell
photo archive + the tree among prayer + by the braille
overcast day + a magpie 's calls + at the seats
sun shadows + on the masks + stuck i out his dream + wrapped in rain
after the family page + the old wings 's light + turns little
sweltering stillness + the shape of the panzer + left on the stadium
glinting on + a retirement card + before the garden
autumn sunset + slowly me parts -- + lemon many
blood-red deep life + packed of a vase + for white
funeral procession + on the clock tower 's regular voice + its child
sunset -- - + there iraq 's + your shadow in my cheek
red lobster- + angels falling , + october night
wisteria - + too thin bare early + starry night
home from porch + laughter takes in the wall + lightning
in the storm + the white road 's path + the shadow
fighting + a fallen passes state salesman + on bookmark
another gets car didj gather + just paint wall
after so . . + a shooting star + between your thighs
her 18th birthday— + without the wall also + its silence
spitting seeds + somewhere between us + it honks
