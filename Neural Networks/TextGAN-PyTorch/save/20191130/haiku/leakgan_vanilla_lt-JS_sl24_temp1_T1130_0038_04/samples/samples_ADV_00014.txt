a rainy day + in the rainforest + swathed in + their divorce
tropical storm warning + a candle 's reflection + in the headlights
anniversaryâ€” + between the park lights ... + a new moon + so somewhere
a walk + with boys + away in our
after the storm + candle in the first page + the smell of rain
early sunshine + a day of a grey path + i do n't know
faltering weekend + on a fish + old butterfly
the blizzard - + the small page + i 'll n't want to pluck .
doing the roof + they left + left into
piles of sawdust + from the impressionist graffiti calls
summer heat + has the know + in the sound of + my eyes
powdering the rush + my mother 's + in minnesota
half a starling 's gaping beak + caught in the end
passing monarchs -- + she tosses the mattress + this on the morning mist
mixed chill ended + the rain
hovering with early + the morning moon + from the winter heat
half moon + at the gull + carved in from the lie
the stare of + a child 's drips + from the ice
lofty drifts + the taste of a flight + of a little stones
drifting wind + the same scent 's + more brightly
california poppies -- + the wind offers the stones + with my phone bottle
planetarium + the child 's lapel + in the gate to the + in the parking spot
after the storm + by the red bright lights + i 'll do n't
ursa major + a thin pier + a new crop of petals + of fog
rivulets + of a cricket buddha + from closes
rain across + the smell of the stones + in my eyes --
urban moon + my walking latches the bag + this 'sold .
endless full + by a red barn + in the snow
crescent moon -- - + the chemo 's drips + on the new graffiti
this gold leaves + a red-tinged cross + of her left
moon + a line of the horse 's + a new friend + has i have out out
dead day + i unpack + the bottle of us + left to + a first time
