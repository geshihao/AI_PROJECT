remembering summer - + a cricket 's falsetto + in the road
cold sunset -- - + the cherry hand 's + a fish still for again
sunrise -- - + my neighbor and call to fall + and the morning window + smell of rain
evening fog -- - + my neighbor 's + to paper + & the light
patriot 's day + homeless man 's + at the front gate + dirtier
customs ' declaration - + determining the value + of a maw man 's breath + in my footprints
the kettle whistles . . + the tree outside the wall + of the sound of + autumn dusk
no rainy day + autumn leaves -- - + a long line + of a broken sub-woofer
falling leaves + my cherry blossom snow + for the old end
scooping steamed rice + and lavender cream in day + in the clouds
early day in + ice chirps + the weeds
a bullock cart + loaded on snohomish county jail tanning infinity
i hug the boy to me— + how brave i have to say + simmers
the recession -- - + the mailman puts + of the cold night
memorial day -- - + under a train takes the lobsters + at its finger + one cold summer
despite still the tea bag + but gorse thin
a price home -- + the moths turns in the wall + of a syringe
a furniture cries + points me to the moon + and alchemy
pint of leaves + of the night shadow + of a bird
he looks cutting me + but a photo in a breeze
corn birthday— + once through my shoulder + along the wharf
line of rain - + my best mother 's left + in the last red yard yard
sudden thunder -- - + the graffiti gathers + new 's makeup + thicker
the hearse day + someone is + my mother 's face
late afternoon sky + a white woman 's call + we go to meet
coming the clouds + dissolving cypress - - + it 's smile songs
harvest moon . . . + the garbage man 's eyes + a new year 's + wrapped in the moon
quiet mist + a magpie 's calls + in the beetle and the hand
`` washing from to ryokan – + my air looks + to to watch the church
on the pillow + his spot on the begging traces + and the kittens
' stream 's ! + three boys it , the lone + at my pocket
the calendar + a child 's navigation chair + from the wall light
