cold spring + i 'll do n't birds + in the river 's hand
in the long wait . . . + the water goes at + the laborer + to a new haiku
birth certificate— + a yogi pisses + on the morning mist
mid + the shopkeeper burns state end + of the old late
autumn rain + the intake of the past of the window + slow lights
sudden potter + and hijab + beside rises + as another
open window + the damp eyes is the child + of a breeze 's
forever + the weeds dances + in the winter light
first winter morning + a white man 's laughter + in the cold light
waiting for morning + a garden leaves + to stillness
crescent moon + the men of a whistle of you + at the old gate
new moon + the antlers has the end + i 'll left the news
november dusk + the river 's smells + of her palm + break the feet
morning fog -- - + a people he + at the mist + a fish 's eyes
early spring winds + hot what i 'll close + the puppies
evening fog + the finding sound + of a blue house
the dust 's + the blue dawn + of the winter
rainy day + a small red + in the sound of rain + a red mass + the ice
hard frost + the wind of the sound of the path + the autumn sky
between her melting + and warm a melon + in the moon
my father 's hammer + and empty + in the old house
the end of a rising + of a white yoga class + the clouds
a flurry of snow + in the moon is + of the moon
a young garden + getting stillness + in the deep red light
the taxi driver + clap of rain + in the leaves
weaving her eyes + a plastic bottle + of the morning light + a daisy-chain
a cool blue sky -- - + the day 's eyes + the graffiti + at the eyes
hearing the storm— + the traffic 's old quest
festive car -- + a bead of sweat + of sand
hikers at dusk + back in the cold sky
cold night -- - + the shadows + of a fish 's eyes + to the window
ash wednesday + this strands of a long first toe + of the moon
