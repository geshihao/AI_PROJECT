i wake of french ! + yes you in an alley + cup of lunar dust
over the feet + of dusk 's voice + is white rain

stars on the phone + my daughter 's legs + smiles at me
windy day -- - + a neighbor 's eyes + i never never than back
winter fog -- - + a beach beauty reflection + in a sparrow for
together + morning heat + riversound + summer coffee
the sound of autumn + a whiff of + from the marsh

an old love mother + at tibetan moonlight + with big lights the cliff
still pond + the cobra pauses ... + i plant onions ...
california poppies -- + the automatic teller machine + eats my tune + his lane

piano recital + a thought came back + are morning clouds
logging road— + the pileated woodpecker + flings its flannel lift
dead love . . + the boys and then + a lullaby
monday coffee + someone vomits among the sunflowers + nehru colder ago beneath
half a convict 's debt + opens its healings
four am . . + she petals + at her tea cup
midnight— + the winter ice + by snow
late night on the sunset -- - + snow how days of sync
the mulberry -- + bits with there + her sing louder
