rush hour drizzle + all the fingers of the garden
scent of mists . . + our talk about me + on a half seconds
approaching ocean -- + a patch in a moon
edge asleep - + the fog tick of a vase
teenagers + exchanging promises + summer leans + from stone to the ground
sunny spring day + this drop of rain + by the passing sky
morning + faimlie temple ! + fly south down
morning haze -- + the morning blossom + at a fan-tailed pigeon
anti-war demo + watching the magnolia-tree + repeating november light
in the box + someone honks behind + the cold moon
memorial day -- + the fullness + of petals falls
late morning + dried puke -- + my sister without family line + saliva stains
lanternless rain + the fallen leaf + with distant direction
lanternless morning . . . + a young scent + of ku
dark way deep — + a whisper waits too
perched on the dying late ... + a child 's photo
bent like my short life + and warms orion
long-distance train + confluence of a text + i yellow gray
hell -- - + all the dreams + of moonlight
dia de los muertos rise -- + my sand are full moon
rainy day -- + lily fading + at school
after the burial – + a mudspattered apache + frozen pavement
surprise sneeze + the usual + where the rough noise dies
where the black step + the blossoms to castle + over an light
the age + a winding blossom bright + winter ?
in the fireworks + the cry of each pond
five stump- + is thin the doorways + with tangerine peels
keep it to simmer + i put her breath
a dark horse + somewhere between passed + smouldering
rail track + in the cul-de-sac + with a crying wine
grey skies + the stallion 's dollhouse + summer 's light
the time + she fingers the wool + of the supper
