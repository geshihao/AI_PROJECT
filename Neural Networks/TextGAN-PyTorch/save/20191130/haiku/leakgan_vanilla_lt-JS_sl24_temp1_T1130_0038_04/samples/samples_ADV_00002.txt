dusk- + all shelter washes want to the ring + of nowhere
i arrange my tie + to hide a stain + misty hollow
finally an saw + of hear the embassy + fills early sea
globe lilies + an year 's rise + up the cover
more piercing + i wash the incense stick + comes fog + a first moon
saturday night moon - + a yellow woman 's + argument
old fountain + surging in a the sound of fried onions + from young just plane .
the page-finders + of occasional the moon + the dental 's dead somewhere sober
on a dark darker + over the scarecrow + in flashes
a plate of pancakes + at the moon + with the stream
runnig water + left between us + one in the last
snowy morning + my mother forgets + who barn was in a drink
lavender blooms + even the cloud-smudged full moon + for a white butterfly
bones shadows a glasses over + the thin while + this summer moon
abandoned farmhouse- + our smile retracts star + in sixth
emptied get-together + another buys a walking + stays like the rain
on the iron whistles . . + a rooster the moon + out ice sync
morphine drip + in my father 's hair + and the dustpan
wildflowers + the slow in my heron + scratch of moon
restless day + to wish + the migrant speaks in the tree + chilled like moon
grey skies + somewhere + closing the growth + of our lilacs
a break in the roof + my feet still too
geriatric ward -- + war flakes swirl outside + far days on the street
sleeping house + breaks through my ears + smoke 's room
wiping the end of winter rain + but hand all + what might . .
the advent wreath + candles lighting the dim moon + as a crescent moon
short night - + more poem + one one to remember
summer heat + dragonflies sounds + of a new moon + on a couch room
hazy day + the steady shrilling + of cicadas
spring warms up ... + my hair + in the roof of the furnace
slug trail -- + another truck + at front a stream 's shadow
crisp morning + the cold moon + the smell of my waist
