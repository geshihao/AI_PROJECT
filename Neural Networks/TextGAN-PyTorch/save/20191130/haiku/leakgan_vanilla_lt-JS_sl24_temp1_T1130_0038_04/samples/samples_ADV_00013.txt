orthopedist 's office -- - + my wife + in full of the rain + left disappears
folding chair + the taste of sweat + with the moon
midnightâ€” + the tea kettle + of the world
spring stars . . . + moments year glean + the same open
chinese market - + the smell of the graffiti -- + i stand the break
new moon -- + a nasturtium burns + where the sauce states ago
scattering each ask + talking of to the christmas ornaments
half rose + red petals across + a different light + on a winter rain
reading + the traffic end of a puddle + i 'll do n't want + to the highest bidder
a young woman + breastfeeding the codfish + fills of my phone + of the roses
the sound + of a child 's lapel + in front of the tunnel
saturday night + light leaves a cat 's sand + and empty + in the front gate
false spring + a day of the match + the lost of black land
migrating swallows + snowflakes blowing + playing at the end + a little song + to the pine
a day of dead of old + aging with the cat + of a robin
winter rain + just under the cat + carved 's too + in my shoulder
screen of pine + roosters too + spring air
shaking lace and hand are ~ + the goldenrod
abandoned farmhouse + the highway + its nostrils
fish away + the white christmas lights + a red shadows + to itself
kitchen embrace + the dandelion + of the moth window
starry farm -- - + a smoker finds shelter + in front of the spider 's feet
night on water + even the hothouse i i shadow + to the full moon
last march day - + the last people + of the world
heavy snow + a baseball new + sweet will again + how the dogs ?
new moon -- - + the graffiti + half-green , half-gold
grey billows + the smell of rain + in the smoke 's + the syringe
mandarin ducks - + a light of blue equinox
empty button + as my breath + in the rose 's eyes + looks on the window
cold spring -- + the wind blows + still a winter begins
falling + sweeping leaves our + in snohomish county : ... + plum blossoms away
cold old page + the old man 's + half with the wine
