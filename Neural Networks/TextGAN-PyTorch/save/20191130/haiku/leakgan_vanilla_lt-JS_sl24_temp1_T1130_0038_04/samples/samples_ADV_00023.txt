after the rain + and the new crop of beer
heat + a white moth lands + in the gate
twin towers + repeating their absence + day 's rain + in the snow
at the cottage . . . + the sound of the sun + a white fish 's shadow
deep room + the taste of a mud + the horse
a fishing 's + right bone of the light + of the old man
delta blues + the asphalt warmth of + of the park
with the yoga + the woman 's eyes + a shadow
halloween pumpkin + the scent of the leaves + of the trees + of a moon
first snow + the scent of my ear + the end of the
sound + of a moon + in the old light
mandarin ducks - + the horn + of the road
mixed new wind + the old dandelion + i do n't steps
early spring rain + the distinctive sound + a jumping red song
scent of pink weekend + on the moon + of a fish
under the end + a new crop of old leaf + of the eyes
around the moon + the white rose 's + in the rain
the tang of the parakeets + with front of the new drops + a daisy-chain
windswept window - + the day 's eyes + a still together
autumn equinox -- + the monologue + of the same yard + in the moon
fall morning + the cat 's eyes + in the front of the gate
harvest moon + the long smell + of a rose
silent night + the distinctive song + of the moon
the enlightened girl wears + the smell of his ceiling
in the path + the silence + the butterfly
cold autumn + a butterfly on the water to pillow + the moon
behind the mist + the day 's eyes + on the rain
november moon + the damp new drop + of the same
new moon -- + the scent of + of the last moon
crossing the end of the willows + a distant red + of the scent of + from a blue
harvest moon + the is their light + on the front + of the new fence
a glass of the child + of suburban + the moon
