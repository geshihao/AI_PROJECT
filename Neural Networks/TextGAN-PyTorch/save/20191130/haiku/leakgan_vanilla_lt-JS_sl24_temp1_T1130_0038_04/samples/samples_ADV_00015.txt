lakeside + the slow smell + of shore to him + too many winter
the page-finders + of a clatter + of of the fence
round the sonogram photo -- + in the leaves
repeating the spot + red eyes + in my eyes
fountain pen ink spill + new station + on my eyes + from the homeless man
dinner ~ + fluttering in the campfire + and the heat + not tonight
in the shade + of a remains + a daisy-chain
the hollow rose + the crocus
night 's lightning + her hair + in the field of her + winter rain
the space + falls through the lift + the memories in eyes + the sun
thunder -- + the lights of her sky + the groom 's perfect higher
east river shopping + dipping a long hair + in the fog
desert calm + the road has erased + she 's shadow + along the wall + of the clover
after the earth + my thoughts of the bed + the new drops + a blue plate
morning fog -- - + the old graffiti + in the moon + of a fish ...
powdering the cobwebs + in the loon 's + winter stillness
here and there + breaking through the mist + on the garden
last of snow + the whistle of a man 's voice
after the rain + the butterfly burning to the wind
still pond + the building marked + than no light + across the wind
january rain - + at the masks + i reach 's + to the railroad
mayflowers + pulling a clear passing + in tibetan window
solar flare - + new york truck + between its sky ... + children 's grave + feeding ...
starry night + puddles of her wait + in the window 's + is still in the barn
more stars -- + road to the dog + with me
a weekend and + and the moon
winter rain + a day pauses + with the wood + the bird
valentine leaves -- + my baseball glove + the lake + in the yard light
photo shopping + the sharpness in the gate on
winter wheat + grass sign it + on a cross of
walking boxes + her wedding fence + in the winter light
faces to find + dogs surround him + a butterfly
