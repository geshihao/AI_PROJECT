first day of october + the sun on the sound of + my face walks + of the window
darkened day -- - + the sound of my + at us + after the light
head : + drifts on the window + a red song of this
all moon + the colours of + a new crop of back from + of the dental photo
snailâ€” + out of a rising + of the april
screen of her + smoke 's + the table
long ago + the roadrunner 's beak + without front
scooping steamed rice + the blur of insects + the warmth of the house + of the orange
mixed rain + a faded bud 's + in front of a blue yoga + nothing through the dark
unexpected guest- + the graffiti 's call + the next
blue sky -- - + the day 's eyes + a glimmer of still not + of confession
wanting to embrace + the whole used to withered list + in the darkness + the smell of rain
late winter cleaning - + my neighbor 's + &
still school - + the day 's voice + of the empty house + a winter daydream
evening fog -- + all the cloud + with friends
traffic thunder + the poor 's pier + wears the wrong end
haiku potato chips + nobody can not as are good + in the sidewalk
still river -- + the sun in the scent of the rain + a clean longer
the fog . . + the horse 's + the laurel
cold snow + a spent leaf + the answering 's light + before time
summer leaves ... + he remembers + to lift the
too winds + extra rush + food before old , + that august morning
overcast light + the graffiti 's depth + of the old leaf + of a moon
between absinthe + the piano in the moon + in a shot-out sign
snacking on + between claps of + the coffeecup still
police sirens -- + the church 's + a new twist + in a clean longer
almost the cool + have left in the ceiling + i has passed + of the lamp
back to the roofs + the white rose + to the flower + of a drinking me
after the rain + the old late pauses + of the window
hazy day + the dog 's sand + and the eye + of his pocket
sunrise -- - + the ups state christmas scent + of a winter
spring fever + christmas songs + the moon 's + in your feet + a new year
