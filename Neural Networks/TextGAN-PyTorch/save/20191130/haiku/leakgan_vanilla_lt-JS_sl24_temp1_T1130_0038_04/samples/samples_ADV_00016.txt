threatening sky -- + a cat turns 's + in the knife 's end
in the hospital + the last moon + in his eyes
at the moon + each a line of a man 's + new address
moonrise + the columbine still + of the cackle of + still this moon
stone and summer - + the smoke 's + in the old apple + through the window
first day of the dreams + at the moon + with a traffic cloud
an brush + of a cut glass 's colour + of spring
a dry maple 's cry + opens the patio , + left our still back
dachau + the rain also waiting + in the fog
summer moon + the cicadas + at the compartment
runnig water + fireflies falling
what thing cries out + at neon + their curtains
sweet peas + a yellowed opens break + he lost the lobsters 's + in concrete
hikers at dusk + but the smell of my waist -- + a sun
the recession -- - + the thorn + the groom 's end of the depth
martin luther king day -- + through leaves the end of the edge + the smell
autumn woods + a carriage circles still + of perfume
baby slows - + through my eyes + half in the road
mass news + long first sky to call to + the scent of rain
spring steady . . . + the old violin + a white fish + from my neck
late night date -- + a balloon 's songs + the graffiti
tide pools + the mailman 's love + left in the sea
a pale moon + electric a long dawn + on the water basin
facing a stiff street + class pushes + the highway
firecrackers + from steps to the sky + a fox 's flight
all winter leaves + the smell of a moor + his mother 's shadow
still close + the world of the hill + to the moon + from the system
grey morning -- + my cat opens + at the sky + of the morning light
dense fog -- + the depth still + in the front of the wind
old wine - + of the pitch-dark and + this cup of a coffee + in the scent
ants transport a friend + of the sun is light
blue farm + he finds the new neighbors + of the moon
