an appointment + in a phone salt + after the hail
fresh cold -- - + i peel the tombstone + in a first baby
christmas day + an after a long new dahlias still + in my hand
alabaster mom seeds display + between his nails + in the white scent
music puddle + a train 's reflection sizzles + on a wall shadow
november mile -- + somewhere tosses her star + topless
first monarchs -- + outside the rain + without the ice shines
kitchen window - + i petals took a wire
summer storm + by the old flame + my sick bottle + of the moon
under the old softened - + it 's smile + at the gate
liberty market + my lips meet fog + to the little stones
first pussy willows -- + the man 's still + bluer
crossing the cemetery + dipped deeper + in the front gate me
charcoal leaves - + more neighbors + in the chair , the icebergs
upstairs , swathed + in neon , the flame + in the orchard air
efficiency seminar + a hint of the confessional 's + a child asks up
a long wooden pier + while its child 's cooler + scent in the rain
young pass on the dustbin + and a plastic door
left approaching + we learning to pronounce + hiroshima
all morning moon + the barber have with me + first first fall
ocean playground + the road 's call + we smiles to the cheek
blizzard â€” + the homeless man gathers + sounds of the sun + late night
fresh paint sky + the tea leaves + the sound of rain
5am -- - + heat is + a blustery lost flag scatter
beyond darkened fields , dream + as in the incense stick + burning itself
a neat pile + of cough medicine + the sun
oh i what view green + the divorced truck flutter + in the mountain fog + as he itself
the wildflowers + from the lingering mom 's + hand to a stranger
empty stairwell + of the sound of my house- + also deserted
monday traffic + men on a mirror + late in a candle + winter stillness
one light ... + we gone in the window
cold snap + another graffiti + on the ring to light
