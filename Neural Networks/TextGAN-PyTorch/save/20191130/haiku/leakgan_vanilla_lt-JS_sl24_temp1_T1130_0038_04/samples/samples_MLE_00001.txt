breakup — + warm a contrail crosses + her left
morning fog + the same time + a white cab
remembering bubbles + a lone leaf still waiting .
shortest day -- - + under a neighbor 's husky + wags his tail
october deep ... + i sip wrap the snow
harvest moon - + a pigeon + on the christmas ornaments
bus tide -- + a wide opens her urn steps + ancient seen
morning haze -- + an old watering + through its shoes
just friends — + the potter 's letters + memorial
my name + with the candles + between sugar
after rain + the aftertaste + unreachable
monday snow . . . + out + she 's left + i enough enough
the stare + of a text + after the
slipping in + the gap
high noon cold -- - + the barmaid kisses me + to the long cloud
empire leaves— + who she tells him + i have lost back the taxi
still air ? + in the road + after a wish
november dusk -- + koi swim + through the sky
of snow + a robin 's heels + afternoon noon
the old town - + a blue left + my eyes
climbing the shape + of the moon— + the turkish baths
hurricane -- + ice but me + a baby heart
church bells + she is cutting + to tune i have it left
traffic asters + summer lights up + on the traffic
cloudburst + the sheperds eyes + there touch the
the day of rain + after a dark road + towards the wind
no snow in the window + the black list + pray
the party + date of mimosa + indian over snow
empty rings + on in the fog + hospital pie
the sun late -- - + another beach swirl + on her umbrella
honolulu airport + breathing cherry + wearing more light
city bound moon -- + the cat of batman have 's light phone ticks
