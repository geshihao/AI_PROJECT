half-light + the frog on the moon + without the way
second husband + along the hill + i open the dove + still in the road
sleet street + through the crow 's + at the headlights
decorating of the pavement + the moon + with the song
valentine 's day + i almost the eyes + the moon 's eyes + on the light
the temple ends + are no begins + to the half
under the sun + i resemble a light + to the rain
the sound of daffodils + a very red + the moon
almost clouds + the smoke 's call + the moon
sharp smell + a first of the sound of + my scent of cayenne
winter + after the fog . . . + a child asks me + in the silence
at either end + of the moon + on the rain
a break in the + the old gold night
dark hallows eve -- - + the only graffiti + in the gate
those shells + in the winter storm + towards the red eyes
northern lights . . . + the tiny shadow + of the moon
-- + yellow blue path + the waterfall + in the front of the red gate
climatic change + the occasional moon + in the front of the moon
typhoon warning + the winter rain + begins + to the red phone
in the child + of a man 's song + to the dustpan
climbing the willows + a child 's + in the funeral
spring stormâ€” + the heavy moon + in the moon
yellow walnut + of the rose + after the hands
one plus one , + the accent mark + the same
among the state rose + each the winter moon
approaching rain + the long ash + on the cherry leaves
news by + the gleam of her hair + in the autumn butterfly
the old town + the empty + still the last whistle
desert heat- + smiles from the past + of old leaves
' side of the house- + arrives saturday --
the blues singer + tells it sits out my kiss + on the old couple + of the empty house
rosebud unfolding + the seed of + of a sun
