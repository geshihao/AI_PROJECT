after the rain - + a voluptuous woman + buried in work
the quiet stable - + the smell of insects
stone cairns + a faded salesman 's woman + algae
long dead moon + i have with work + the graves of a pile call for again
heavy sunrise + reading a book without + a traffic shoes
sun on the silence + the tea 's eyes
snow ; + a winter phone jar s house
so many ways + the ash garden + my kissed
the offering + in front of the window + degas ' ballerinas
two moons + grass makes my lift + beckoning like my tongue
three shades too dark + the air nodding + in the desert
neglected garden + the dance of goodbye leaves + on the stone
smoky moon + a child hammers re-explains shelter + pray to heaven
in the ruins + where the carousel . .
new clouds + autumn heat . . . + a shadow play play
june night + light rain to an sun + white breaths
crickets ' songs + awakened i coffee + in the park blossom
music to watch + a whiff + with flow of fireflies + smell in
december rain storm + through the floor migrates + with shadow
old flame opens + the smell of smoke + winter
a b-52 + thunders on the lights ... + winter rain
first raindrops + all a cell goes up me
hail to the armour + a quiet mist + on the traffic lights
church christmas + close street cricket in the last light
sirens -- + lemon scented window + a phone call
end midnight . . . + the bars + with the orange
threatening -- + she asks has there + i think so mobiles
spitting seeds + far into the bouquets ... + white over light
perseid rain- + too much spring bell + following haiku ... - + alzheimer ?
fog lifting + the ring the depth + of melon
just thunder + the mention of eye can + thoughts of rooster
the steady shrilling + looking and a prayer + scent of lilacs
