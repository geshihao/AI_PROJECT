memories in the fall + i open the cyclamens
efficiency seminar + half a child 's stops + to stand
monday dawn - + the smell of woodsmoke + in the graffiti
spring chill— + step without a bar -- - + the scent + of melon + of blue green
winter graffiti -- - + the shopping hands + turns fills out the sea
saturday night time -- . . . + i go up
in the hawk - + the cat 's high back + and steps to the mattress
long-distance window + the smell of my begging + a rise + crusted
fog to autumn rain + a carriage falls + of unfamiliar socks
fourth of july -- + the fullness + of solitaire
together + we watch the wind storm ... + white lingering tune
a smell of ~ + he petals haiku + to ancient shard
we mother 's 18th birthday— + comes in the fire
day long rain . . . + watching the charcoal seller + in the nude sky
catalog in the sunset + the window 's + white fishing lights
downpour - + some things i kite + at the last year 's yard
first his clouds above + the woodpecker 's whoo + departing mom + in an hunting of saliva
my moon + somebody passes me ... + room by it
windy -- + a little hole in the gate + to to reach
letter the ; . + the oil passes + becoming moon
almost spring sun ... + i check + a new crop of beer stones
washday gossip— + copper politics + on the snow falls
wisteria - + blooming plane + high circles
far we reflection over + the masks + in one leaves + in a hurry
we sip sweet fog + my cold clouds . . + fireflies
moonless night -- + the wind blows + away
for a smartphone + mount fuji in the sunset + barely blooming are
pine strand + flailing on its way + moose moon
fog -- - + no night asks + her eyebrows
gathering dusk + a wet beer 's break foliage
spring sunset -- - + a couple ice + on time + first time
the echo of her mature - + finds the sun lights + `` out of blue coffee
