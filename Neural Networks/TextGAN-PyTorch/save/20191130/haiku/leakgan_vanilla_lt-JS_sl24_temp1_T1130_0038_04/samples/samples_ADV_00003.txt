raking street + a cold snow + of a fan-tailed walk interrupted
french kissing + on each gold than snow + halfway lights
an day healing + a prayer + into the car 's shadow + between the well
from the sun storm + begins to our + first robins
seniors dance + the honey + covered still higher and higher + by clenched tastes
long august day + on the walls of the land
mile of curve + an ice 's cream turns
refugees rush + on farenheit - + stirring extra coffee
twilight -- + we what read her luscious , + blow of my throat
central park + a cart sweet + near its notes
a teacup + from a blue haiku + to light
bullfrog chorus + many finished among the little stones
southend-on-sea + freshly fried chips + on the leaves
summer stars + someone seeds waiting . . as + water to the hose
she wears tight new nail + not to hide last
in the yard shops + a child 's sick song + suddenly a star
still gold petalsâ€” + a pregnant balloon + monochrome
sultry sky -- - + the ups socks slips looks
snacking on + echoes inside the potter + full moon
remembering summer - + the silence + to the surface
my moon + falls my morn -- + the marketplace + feeding florida
maws fecht ower the bucket + drowned where i do it the birds ticks
orthopaedic clinic + a three-legged chair + now the maple 's call + to lift work
saturday night wind -- - + he a cobra looks + on his sober
nun and monk + the cry candles + from my neck
harvest 's sun + the sound of women + appartment block
temperature rising + and empty track + the joy of the dandelion + mosquitoes mosquitoes
the sound of blue + blocked fills if + undone
looking across + the distant buddha + wears the supper stream
sculpting + clay ears + we out of tissue + before moonlight
gare du nord + the fresh butterfly , the avalanche zone
blue sky -- - + she also + at moonlight
