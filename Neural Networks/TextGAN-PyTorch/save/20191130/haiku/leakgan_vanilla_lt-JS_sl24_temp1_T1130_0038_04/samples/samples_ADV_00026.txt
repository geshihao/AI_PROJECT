a dry maple + in the cat + one in the stream
winter rain + the graffiti 's veins + the spent path + the avalanche zone
amidst the myrtle + carved in granite + in the morning light + the first snow
new moon + the day of the old stove + a new + of her line
cold spring sun - + a red haired + & the photograph
farther and + the quiet drone of + of the rain
facing a tip of the window + the winter
garden + in the winter light + a a rose 's eyes
her 18th socks + the moon 's eyes + in the heat + of the winter day
old rush + sets asphalt + in the window
heat . . . + the fluttering of a sun + the rain
market tracks + on the the old snow + of a shot-out sign
summer 's end + a dog 's + in the window
both feet slide + in the nail across the road
in the old flame + the icebergs
new moon + at the scent of + of the wind
autumn + in the end of the old + a red song
the nearly glare + of the open + of the winter moon
a maple leaf + with the fence + the crime
carefully date + ferris wears the car 's radio edge the cliff
solstice + the shell in a eyes + of the red eyes
morning haze -- + lemon the wind + in the snow
festive season + the whistle of the road + to the tunnel
first juice + the faint red
morning haze -- - + the graffiti 's + in the morning light + still on the front
mid her man + with a fish + in the snow
squash vines + in the winter graffiti + from the red thoughts
morning moon + the distinctive + still with the window
to september moon + the smell of the leaves
the kettle whistles . . + the door of the world of rain + a red way
onion skin + the state rose 's eyes + in the the red
long night + with the barn -- + the tenderness + of the window
