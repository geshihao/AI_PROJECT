the cold morning + the smell of the rain
under the autumn wind + the red
neither the light of a coffin + the wind
the sky of + the first rose + the moon
a long morning moon + the moon + in the eyes
buenos aires tango + in the gate on the
new beach + the new moon + in the moon
open window + the moon 's eyes + in the wind
winter + the sound of rain + the rain
the blue moon + the new leaves + of the red eyes
the end of the sunset -- + a day 's silver
sunset + the last of the red sky + of the bottom of the
moon + the smell of the rain + in the sun
mother 's eve + of the way the stones
evening fog + the mausoleum
this winter sun + a a moth red + over the tunnel
mountain wind + the smell of the rain + in the red
the smell + of a red + in the moon
blue sky -- + the sound of a sun
last firefly - + the smell of + in the incense
life of the pines + a hill + on the front
in the child + of a man 's eyes + the butterfly
the spent house + the sound of + a red longer + of the scent
hurricane -- + the truck dumps asphalt
cup of the + the moon 's eyes + the red
the tree + the winter heat
a tunnel of + the sun
a spent coffin + the mountain
the first path + the sound of the rain
the sound + of a red words + in the sound
a morning moon + the new moon + of the wind
fever 's + the only the old refinery + of the red
