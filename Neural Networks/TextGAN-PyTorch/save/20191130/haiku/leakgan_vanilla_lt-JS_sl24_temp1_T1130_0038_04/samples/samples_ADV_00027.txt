crust moon + on the sky + of a red
quitting the end + of a red leaf + with the white
the world + of the barn moon + the winter moon
summer moon + the baby 's churning light + in the moon
rain + the sound of a sun + a red song in the path + the autumn sky
on the old dog + the light of the wind
thunderstorms + the smell of rain + in the moon
sets a gap + in the moon + from the shadow
open window + the hand of the office + of a man 's end
christmas breeze + the junkyard men + of the streetlight
her lips + the butterfly
long ago + the garbage man 's + at the moon
long candle on the moon + the smell of the tunnel
crystal night + in the winter sky + of the red red eyes
the moon + of a pause of the walls
sunday morning + the loon 's + i have n't + to front the newborn
stepping on a clothesline + in the autumn rain
heavy rain + the last moon + of a heart
in the old late + the distinctive cry + of a white sake
cold autumn -- + a nasturtium burns + the tune of the tunnel
epiphany ... + an elixir of the heat + of the moon
sudden hail + the pregnancy test eyes + in the old gate + to the rose
autumn sea + the heat . . + the last moon
filtering in + in the road + of a winter rain
market wind + the widow 's churning end of the eyes + the red eyes
dead-end road + but the same moon + in the moon
desert lot fog + a bead of the rain
through the sun + the child 's old + in the sound of
winter drizzle + the junkyard light of a book + in the empty
cold rain + the many road + to the new moon + in the ice
sales wind + the winter day 's eyes + a swan 's web
first spring sky + the only the gull + the cry of the rain
