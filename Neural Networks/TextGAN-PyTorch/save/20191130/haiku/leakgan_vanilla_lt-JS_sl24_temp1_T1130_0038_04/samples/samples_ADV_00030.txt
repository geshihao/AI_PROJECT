a blue night + the front of the moon + of a girl 's song
crystal path + the waterfall + in the smell

a only somewhere + of a new crop of eyes
smoky moon + the leaves
the cry of the frog + the little 's
the tunnel + of the house + of a red
waiting to the phone + the moon 's + and then the light
this night 's + the slow sound + of a red
the recession -- + the hammer 's + a new year 's eyes
typhoon warning + a little 's + in the empty
tropical storm - + in the gate in + a traffic window
the empty house + the sound of the + the rain
eclipse + the last moon
