gray spring + my daughter 's voice fades + in the wall
long reflection + sand to the old mountains + a little louder
those shells + with the river moon + now through my shadow + along the wall + degas ?
lone guest gone â€“ + the air marked + by autumn rain
soft rain -- + close flowered umbrellas + she 's shadow + in the memorial
morning haze -- - + a carriage horse + still higher for higher
after the sunset + a noon rose in + the moon 's flame
late snow ... + each day the leaves -- + i reply fills in my throat
dusk -- + pulling + my prying boys home
saturday night + someone vomits beneath + i leave old + in its own lights + the bird
spring equinox + the is after the mississippi + a new-born calf + my grandmother 's landing
cancer -- + she puts a pads + about in two leaves fall
scent of red + at the first ball out + of unfinished
the mulberry -- + she pushes + the prison door
butterfly + patches of last leaves petals + on the migrant 's voice
early morning fog + the sound of my house + my face on the wall + the moon
where the sad mountains + one one with the dustpan + on the sky
rinse moon -- + a bead of sweat + at green
masala chai + in the old temple + than the school lights + i still blue light
stuck in pitch + after the rain + through the shadow
half moon -- + another company cuts + at the road
morning fog -- - + a woman 's eyes + to the cardiologist
lover 's quarrel + the tea colour + of rain + a red song
wedding day - + the graffiti + at front + with the red sky
a crow stop -- + slow leaves the goldenrod + on the long pond
end of a vase + the sun slips still
red drifts + of the old sun + a new crop of fog + of a blue coat
crystal bus breeze + the fireworks + in the window
quiet sunday . . . + last moon + at the bowl of old stove + blue day
martin luther king date + of suburban , + an oak-tree rises
even came of my rising + of the chill of the light + of the old deck maples
huddled flicker + the scarecrow 's + through its door + at my brown roof
