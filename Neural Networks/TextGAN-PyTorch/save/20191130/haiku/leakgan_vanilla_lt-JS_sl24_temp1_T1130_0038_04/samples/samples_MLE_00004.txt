season 's route + of her lost + in the same train
wiping full dust + a swollen tick + in the stream
half moon + something playing + in the taste
honking at a the twelve-carriage platform : + — egret boats chat
this old barn + my fence + one that shadow
winter rain -- + i celsius in a missing light + the night 's couple
snacking on + between claps of light + on the thatch
sego lilies + the new killed + half mom year
back to ask + at haiku + her shoes
the sound + of a bug tree + a red bicycle
arctic air + a christmas leaf + between the ice
family get-together + another antlers sprout + the butterfly to home
first day of the hotel + he tells the graffiti + to the hose
first day -- - + my neighbor walks + childhood
somber skies + drifts of your crescent + in the address mist
early rain + the sound of hot summer --
scent of newsprint + etched into the full 's eyes
the first town hanging + the child 's lights
first pussy willows -- + my music signs + the day
morning fog -- - + a tombstone + in rice sea
dead-end road + for a cold rain + a baby !
winter evening + another air flutter + the little notch
moving over + the fallen leaf 's death + also left
boyhood friends + sparks the lights : + the dialysis
the page-finders + on his child + beyond another
before at the orchard + i hands here + rising
from the silence + your eyes
my ford explorer + on a never-ending harness ~ up
new housing -- + hammer string + between heat reach
to lead the life + on my window—a mother 's face
distant woodchopper + in the white world + without direction
another birthday— + another thought tries + to farenheit
