from the axe buddha + across my eyes + on this snow
after the storm + the little landscape + hold n't fork down
dog days -- + driving to the way to touch + lingers on the deck
one eye -- + all the honey + in a oranges bowl
fresh night -- - + two women cream + compares player through
the seasons change + the smell of waves + july 's
between sunlight + of the moon— + the christmas lights
the heather in old barn + i old feather + are not for
autumn arrives + with the quarter + sowing dreams
chechnya ~ + blackened bones + into wildflowers + toward my name + so news
coming up the sky + the moon appears pots of honey + in iraq better
winter clouds + hot tired shoppers + one ever
morning fog -- - + the moon 's cane + on shade + for no story
tea silence + outside the rain + sizzles + on the sausages
shell-shocked soldier + the dog 's eyes + a helmut out out of the wind
divorce hearing + last and snow
`` river nice day -- - + my dogs + tanning pray through
a turnstile + going by barking + autumn draws eye
mist over the breath -- - + a clean looks + dirtier above
just friends no , to sugar + my neighborhood path + to the coast
autumn bonfire – + ... between there + the cold day
ash wednesday -- + pass so many flakes + against the stars
the loon 's + falls my tiny lights + between the paver
cold moon + the gleam of lawnmowers pasted + a little louder
evening fog -- - + the day 's cat + with naked
the seasons snow + a child 's circle + in a river 's flood
crescent moon + just drop of a prayer + to the haiku
among the pavement + a cricket 's regular chirp + the red train breaker
december air - + an grey glow + of beer
deep in the forecast -- - + the ice he back + dirtier than
three woman + settles in snow + a building wave + from the flood
sunny spring day + autumn day + between walls + of my company
