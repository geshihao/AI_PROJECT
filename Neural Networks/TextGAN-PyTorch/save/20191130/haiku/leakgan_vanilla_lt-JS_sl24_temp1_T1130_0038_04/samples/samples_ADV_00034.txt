the moon + with the winter
after the rain + the red light + in the winter
long night + in the sound -- + a red without + of the moon
a long square + in the old house + the red
a raptor + the beetle 's eyes + the turtle 's eyes + in the winter
sleepless night + the deepens of the autumn heat
the haze + of a missing moon + the red
late of the bus + the sun in the moon
cold rain + the time
scent of + of a cloud of + the moon
dividing the tree + the only the moon + in the
all the end + the winter
the old lady + with the small page + of the moon
day moon + the moon 's eyes + in the sky
lanternless night . . . . + the old lights + the moon
abandoned calm + the old man 's + at the orange
a pagoda + the warmth of + in the autumn
the end of the moon + the rain
moon + the widow 's warmth + of the moon
snow + with the autumn tide + the rain
the price + of the sound of + a red louder
a cold moon + a snail 's call + the fading song
i hug the lake + the moon + in the snow
a hawk searches + the sound of the autumn
hell -- - + the barmaid 's heart + in the red
blue sky -- - + the moon 's eyes + in the moon
crossing the moon + of a gate on the
new clouds + the front of the road 's eyes
the sound + of the red
tempest in the rain + the evening
the morning + the sound of + the rain
a morning moon + the new killed + the front of the moon
