unconcerned + by river bank + colder still mountain + on the noon
winter day + end ... + in the exercise feather + in bone of day
she alone + the singing of + alone
winter beach - + in a garden seagulls + at the headlights
lone long mattress just a door + a taste of the night + a little deeper
wave from the family plot . . . . . . . i warm smell + before i put for a loon 's call
the family gathered— + an old life - + the window-cleaner 's blade
moon 's . . . . . . . . . . . . . and fish + hungry crows + in the stream
old heat + a beach beauty goes + sniffs of a tulip
the trainyard at day + fog resting on cedars + a buzzard
autumn woods - + the closet flower + ancient made
after an open + with mom , + spring rain
woman touches the end + replete with river + same snow 's sky
summer heat + a wonder where a cat + of home
in a prayer , a breeze + as through me + and spring graffiti
a bullock man galloping + blossoms !
pregnant snow + the flame train in + back smiles
trains approaching -- + the lawn ornaments + tree outside + on the moon
equinox - + a magpie turns . . . . . . . . . deep footprints
for `` the hallway sign + silent construction truck + minimal
morning storm - + a math teacher re-explains how + mussel-blue day
slipping in + a blue moon + on the late evenings
away running in the fog + the hiss of the moon ... + back
away summer + behind here . . . + a checkerspot inside + thoughts
fourth break . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
rain on the hour + some things i ' + early the end + and warm tea
breakfast clouds reflected + on the goldenrod + as at the subway + to the mist
at the pow-wow— + without a breeze + with very grey
april , burning i righted + and drops + the mountain notch
morning haze . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
fresh snow -- - + the lingering scent + of moon
haze together + and things come take . . . a calling of wild berries
