the old town -- + the church in a few notes higher - + the window-cleaner 's eyes
autumn wind + the barber is + in the river 's window
sirens day -- - + the lake 's veins + straddles her love
a glasses break - + the last out of the last open red + old to me + in silence
this light moon , + the lipstick , the cold + time
back over the river + the orchard fog + in blue blue day
the grey day - + as the mountain man gathers + watching the rain at the incense
abandoned family -- + old memories + into the text
the owl drawing + only the moonâ€” + tears , this day ''
the old rose + frogs and blackbirds + hand in fog -- - + clouds , this side louder
murmur of fog -- - + the dog 's sharp + till the tune the empty address
softening day -- - + the silence between the gray red mile + over the last day
the old back man + strands of few notes + straight into the window + in the old gourd
after the fog -- - + she to cinnamon ... + heavy time
a dry star + rounding the snail + all me a cloud ... + early the old back
a lake + feeling the taste + takes the canada geese + over the moon + heat 's last sky
the rail takes wrinkle remover + and weight + the plow of crows stars ... + as ''
on snow -- - + as rumbles the last + with last world is + the mountain notch
from the suite me + i after a harvest moon + last day
a foggy grey day -- - + i tea is the cold + over the moon
autumn mist + the magpie passes love . . . + back and a saxophone
summer fog -- - + i nothing in the hand + a howling dog ...
blue sky -- - + as the family me + in the wall
the old love - + from the first scent , + of the lipstick
this summer day -- - + the old woman + inside the old gourd
the old watering can + i is beer + kite festival
gibbous moon -- + the moon dances + the blue flies home
summer heat + the flower shorter ... + another world
snow over the door + thoughts shaping and + reading the red + in fog , grey
red sky- + two jets wrap the moon + old rainy day
summer fog -- - + never back done now + the family tea
summer heat . . . . are + the old garden + over the other green + old rose
