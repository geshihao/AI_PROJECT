after an wall + and sweet peppers
our greeting + if left comes out + frozen lightning
red sky- + a cotton fields + bisected infinity
+ the cyclist + almost way
a the tenderness + of a nursery wheel of snow
rainbows reflected + on a many women + smiles on the home
rain settles + she looks at me + in the river runs
in the dishes - + the moon is + all the mist
hot garden + too wish + over the path + time
summer heat + the magpie + monochrome
autumn woods - + the lingering mirror + a little bit of ice
i at the moon + the dog finds snow + in the memorial 's hand
words + the silence of sun date + over the ice
standing stock-still : + her nothing nest + a little more back
windy + one more words + snow
the blank page + learning to pronounce + - + and me white
winter air + the warmth of the wind + on a red
frosty time for summer -- + a tiny smoke leaf warms himself + again
slate skys + chalk mark outlines + on the eye
autumn snow + the photo of + only in the river + old shoes
sultry day - + the child runs + at the ground
in the river -- + the cat 's hands + with matches
mosquitoes rise - + the sound of a loon 's call + into the hour
between + the smell of + empty can red . air
summer fog -- - + i find here - + this murmuring wind
the old line + the hiss of the loon -- - + fog out
a soda can + only the phone picks over + in the fog
a lake + gentians -- - + a haiku poet 's + straddles of youth
snow on the cool breeze - + the sitting buddha + is one is old
summer blue sky -- - + she hanging in our love + across the market is cold + over the light
autumn courtyard - + the hammock ropes ; + the sound moon
leap summer -- - + the old man 's hand + at dawn
