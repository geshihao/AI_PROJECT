october autumn trail -- + the shoe shine man looks + at dawn .
smell of + divorce rates + mating butterflies
a dry heat— + over of my eyes + a daisy-chain
first firefly - + cover a horse + suddenly
meditating and child + the shape falling snow + old no child
the trainyard at winds + growing out of + their opening in + in the deep footprints and tea
after the day + a deer hesitates + in the mist
harmonica player + he marvels + lost along the streetlight
among cigarette-ends + and lingering day + thoughts of the shade
empty street + it - + i reach of her gate + at dusk
hazy dusk - + the sound of rose + as it is one
lanternless wildflowers + i walk to buy + room again
summer solstice + a child 's marble bag bursts + dreams with rain- + snow
the mirror - + with a line seagulls + changes
graveside sermon ended + the cow 's breast + + crescent moon
a 18th birthday— + for a text + spring rain
tonight 's quake - + a sun 's cry her + missing tooth
sunset -- - + flies has awakened + the bookstore window
the way from the path + ... + of a breeze + from the blood moon
masala chai + at an ex-girl friend + for me better
may sky -- - + and the highlighted passages + well takes the bedroom
prayers night + the silence + of the sea
he winds off come i , + the scent + of the lupine leaves
my daughter 's 18th birthday -- - + the slow afternoon 's + he squerrs 's shouthers
crescent moon -- + the dandelion leaves + the morning noise
firecrackers + far away locked to + children waken screaming
at the moon + the train is silent + in the passengers
wind in over + a moth ’ s howl + flutters in me
mass over the winds + long york + high definition
in the child + only the window screen + back up the tunnel
faded postcard + the only slice left + are increasing
a tunnel of sky - + scent of mimosa + from his eyes
