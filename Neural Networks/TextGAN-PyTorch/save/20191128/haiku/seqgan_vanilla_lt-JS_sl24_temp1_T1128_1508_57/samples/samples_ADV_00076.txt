the light of the fog + cold moon + the fan of a buzzard
a tunnel of fog + over the yard , + the cherry blossom
summer heat + all the grey man + on the tunnel
grey today + a teakettle + whistles
sunday fog at the cove + the world of mint way + nothing in flower blooms
first many wanderers balloon + smiles suddenly
a snowy footbridge + the train runs + at the sky
sheets of night + and passengers , + the moon
season of mists . . . . . . ... that smoke + between tea
quitting time + a moth + heads to my back
half moon . . . . + back and forth on our + rain
autumn maple + a name of the silence + she looks for + trackless snow
the photo + rising shopping ~ + leans turns rain
the sound + of the headlights + thoughts of fog
summer heat + my air conditioner + sweating
in the rain + a pregnant woman + sing turns over the + to a old gourd
huddled smokers + bits of the hospice + + on today deepens
temperature rising + the dawn reaches the snow . . . red
falling leavesâ€” + another taste + back on a rest
the old woman , + a white train rise is + on the other fruit
windswept walk + rouging her cheeks + candles planted on a train
a dull ache + i write + in the fog
summer heat + a farmer only + at the mountain notch
august wind + a summer moon + is heavy with snow
first time + the smell of some first fleas + back to a candle
autumn sunset + the daughter 's sick patch + and snow
side before the darkness + i read the wind + so windows
summer fog -- - + she asks + she smiles for a tulip
deep at snow + the slow way + with me barn
veterans ' -- + a echo of the sky + and in the wind
after an open window + a white scent + of a subprime crisis
the underside of way + through crows hover + ... the sound
