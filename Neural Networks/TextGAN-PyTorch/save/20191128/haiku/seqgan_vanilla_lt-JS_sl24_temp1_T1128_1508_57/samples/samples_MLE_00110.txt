saturday night - + summer holds the + of the bottom of cooking
cloudy car + white white morning + old winter dusk
drinking mulled wine + in my wedding sky
the crowd + starts singing + share out of + the faint rose
wooden buddha + at the world behind— + at work
the price of s station + sweeping no answer + for a kiss
a sudden rain + the honking looks at her + missing me into the room
deep spring + the clouds drift by you + on his cell for sale
farmer 's day gift + follow a flight + sing onions
those morning + a sweet sigh
divorce court + the oak colder + at summer day
rush hour traffic + a lizard 's ribs pressed + against concrete
another birthday— + neighbor has busy + at dawn
behind something + snow on the autumn + a dentures shop
sunrise -- - + a tear of embalming fluid runs + and a lit candle
lanternless of night - + the ring of the snow + darkness room
waiting room + thoughts on the mist + for set back
heat , walden : + home outside + the tree 's grave site
failing light -- + counting the stars + in the fog
blood-tinted soil + where a haiku poet 's flame + crackles in my umbrella
morning fog + two passengers steps + crescent moon
a headlights + in the crow 's spire + so immobile
morning heat + the mouse fall again
dia de los muertos -- + trembling leaves + in the cherry blossoms
old garden gleams + in the earth air
stepping on ended + in the river + thoughts of two irises
autumn downpour -- - + an old country + goes on top
sad news -- + the blackbird close
musty heavy silence + hot buttered wine
rainy night + we enter the yard + smell of plastic
troubled sleep -- + and secrets + frozen on top
winter rain + the tip of the sea breeze
