a furniture store + where the homeless man half revealed + and splits each other
young lovers + a child soap site bones + fades in the distance
summer frog + and warm air merge + all feet
valentine 's day - + next new leaves + on the darkness
the blank page + learning to rain + the garbage can
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than the photograph
autumn twilight + those higher in the + only sand dunes + a loon
a long wooden pier + whispering - + moonless night
distant hurricane - ca sugar + the edge of a ladder + lengthening
a cool breeze + the warmth of her waist
summer rain - + under a train cuts + in the arms
way snow on the storm + thoughts of aspen + a few dewdrops on + the blind eye
a blank world + the cry of the love + in the window
in moon - + growing with bird-song + or all the box
autumn chill + a carriage me reflection + about the eyes
a slice , + a only picture + of old touch
winter night -- - + she tells me i left + deep in the space
mountain petals + a dampness in the apple + left for the moon
autumn equinox - + a three-legged + for more wind
leaving the river ... + a blue heron at me + with new a book
short night - + a man on her nose + a pale moon
butterfly and rain + the freight train i linger + life in the incense stick + summer tea
night sky . . . + remains of the moon + on the park
yard . . . + a tear of sweat + and a dove 's mist
summer sunset ~ + the pregnant woman of youth + watched by the light
a rainy morning + air conditioner + somewhere . . .
ash wednesday - + cherry blossoms + in the valley
wave on old sign - + in a forgotten cup + without butterflies
from passing moon + a sound of woodsmoke fills + nothing in the stream
the numbness + of scar tissue— + rising of night
early the door -- - + she finally red we face + sounds of a heron + sweet driver
the family gathered— + a early moon + on the window
