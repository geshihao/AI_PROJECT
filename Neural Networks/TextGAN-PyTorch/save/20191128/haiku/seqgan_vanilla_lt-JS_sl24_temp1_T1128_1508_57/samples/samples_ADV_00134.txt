the old love - + fog resting on the + terrorists
a tea gets colder + on the window - + two conversations
smell of the day + old to me— + the river gift the ice
the blank page + learning nothing + snow fills the other birthday -- - + summer day
the old woman , + the last memories + in the door , a address color
the debt ceiling , river + passing is a plate only
autumn mist -- - + the last blossoms + the winter solstice
a bullock cart + loaded high might + at the pond moon
late train -- + the sound of the edge + the smell of a list our garden
the bottle may hand in fog , + the old + of uncelebrated birthdays
this for a day hides + a kid , + her neighbor ’ s last + in the barbed wire
the trainyard at fog -- - + the old man 's + rose scented -- - + the wall a path
autumn sun - + the last glimmering + of a saxophone
the clatter + of grey drip + as the moon
the mattress incense + turns in the last + smell of a heat 's moon
the best lies + a sitting breaks + the cooler
the family gathered— + old man 's reflection + the last path
even the beach blade + the old stove + back to a raindrop a rest , red tide
a lake + feeling the woods + with the way to be . . . . + spring fog
summer ’ s day + i back from the mountain + old memories
red sky- + a checkerspot in our want + lock is fog
heat storm ... + the old tombstone + its wine chirp the
autumn mist ... + another poem + the last home
the church in hand , a snail passes me . . + the last bottle 's wall
the old town -- + the mouse trapped + on of cold
the rail tracks + the real iris bluer + than the alley
autumn equinox - + the smell of a hot moon + in the cooler
migratory pelicans ... . . + the old man gathers + for five languages + at the border town
i long june day , . . . deep cold moon + the crescent moon
autumn wind + a glimmer of youth ... + early
fog over the darkness + neighbor in bad today + empty blue light
a lake + feeling day + the scent of + old gold brightly
