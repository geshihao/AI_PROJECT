pine strand + repeating with + with unfinished poems
summer longing + a greenfinch moves + is over the moon
crescent moon -- - + the old man 's hand ... + long gone
beer bottles + clink and drops - + long the air
autumn blue sky -- - + july snow and + thoughts on
gulls fight over the dustbin + at the fog + all the wind
red sky- + a hint of the gate + in wildflowers
a lake + fogging up the party + moonlight at flow
the old train -- + at the something homeless + lock of crows
a lake + dobi-wallahs slap + river flows on
train whistle— + she has + the seed packet left + in the hall
frozen at auction : + and one the apple + fresh mango
memories + winter evening + mother on the over
winter fog -- - + even the homeless + evening milk
way back back , + a sitting home + the scent of
summer heat + a fat toad + tiny flower + back
fog over the branch , + a contrail crosses + all the family bags grey
early morning fog -- - + i a farmer on the window + a midge
autumn equinox - + the child runs + across the wind
on the pavement + you at the stone leaves + the bug light
winter day darkness - + talk of the sky
the family gathered— + a man standing outside + the oak love + half moon
grey day + through some nothing + i have over the old + eyes
unripe pomegranates -- - + i nothing in the window , red tide
a short haiku + staring at the branch a bottle + early
december blooming night -- - + she 's warmth + right up the winter
summer cut birthday + wings who wings + the hidden love
snow covered temple + ... + turns in the building + over the green lights
thumbing through + a turkey looks + home
first snow - + the old woman 's manners + just out the
winter fog -- - + the heart-shaped tracks + of old names
between the sky + ... dangle + before i linger
