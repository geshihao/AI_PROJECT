cold moon - + nothing in the faux - + in the shop-window
the rail tracks + the real iris bluer + than the alley
dark clouds at the center + of a grey beach + and spring drops
mist lifting + the last of spring + over the mist
end ... + the river 's + in the old friend 's sky
tools rusting + fluttering in fog -- - + the night
letting the branch its world + the real iris + in the railings
slow the doctor + each green geese + plum is one the bed
the old woman ... + a puff + umbrella blossoms + on the tracks
morphine drip + right i follow the old bed
fog over the green truck + the answering rose grey i + still on the moon i deep
rainy day -- - + she 's fingerprints + in the ice .
the family gathered— + shadow and dreams + old back came light ice
summer heat + the dragonfly lands + in the valley
dusk ... + two island beer + beyond my stops + to the funeral
after the fog + the amish man looks at + one in the sun
the old nail term— + the last colour + grows rush direction
winter - + and i back story ... + early
summer 's day -- - + my wife + the train chill
summer morning + the scars + of silence . . .
the old bed + the tenderness + of moon
the way summer heat + the air conditioner drips + again
summer ’ s day , balconies + scent of wind , the window + too wordy
the day hides . . . + the graves of the back + of a early window
the age + the child . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
spring day -- - + even the petals love back into the + spring sun
morning fog -- - + the sound of heavy time + moon into snow
blue sky . . . . + counting the incense stick love + it 's back
the room ’ s day , + a white conversation + fall
first day of the moon + the laborer + almost falling is + in the family
the line of cars + on the family earth + a turtle without up
early spring day . . . + the red heels + the last sky
