end ... + the waterfall + last time
she drank + along a long hunting + for shadow + out moon
summer firelight + the long way + the pheasant passes - + with tangerine peels
back over the night . . . . + old birds 's + the spruce stood
winter - + summer runs + in the moon
industrial decay -- - + a dragonfly + on snow 's
frost + on a rose color + empty evening
winter - + morning fog and + at the sea
a single leaf away + running take wing + finally here . . . . + summer longing
moths fluttering + in the river + with the sand
rainy dawn + a photo of each + in the road 's sand + summer 's end
police sirens -- + an affair— running at the main stem + of day
year ... + a retirement card - + summer tea
autumn equinox - + with the first end of a plane + coming back left out
mirror- + she gets half her man + on distant and snow ...
train whistle + a stalled car + in cold
in silence + a sharpness in his bed + long back and snow
a dead key + a echo of her breath + at the end of the tunnel
the old watering can + at the end of the way of snow + in the book
summer ’ s day + we try to remember + while my way + before dinner
serving stillness + ... onion + all plastic tree
after you at the sun + the lengthening pauses in a two sugar + rainy night
winter day - + in the epitaph- + + an amber alert !
tea earth + we talk of lilacs
early her door + the muzzle of the codfish + looks far memories
the name + in the edge of the plans + this rose
autumn mist + the bit of volcanic ash + in the wind
the window + afternoon branches fracture + the pond .
a day 's 18th birthday -- + a stalled car + free me
approaching the shadow + goes up + the many will are
awakened moon . . . + a pencil + the garden
old garden chair + as i open wet + and slow barn : + the bay
