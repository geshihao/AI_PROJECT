sunrise -- - + a golden dot on the sea + thoughts
summer heat + the barber sign + around the garden
the wind of + a few spots of yellow bush + a daisy-chain
summer heat + the scars + of uncelebrated birthdays
a soda can + too many stars + and spring
a soda can + this way i warm to + clouds scatter the home
crowded subway early + and a text + fog to the sky
mass over grey sky + the river 's open + house
in a beach house + all the rain gathers + + the winter light
on the passengers yard + blossoming in the sky + on snow
snowy moon ... + blossoming in the fog + scent of light is . .
the highest branch + in the rainwashed eucalyptus + deep footprints
autumn wind + plum 's handwriting ... + over the wall
a soda can + each year + at me
deep deep deep + fog and fall + over the sun
dusty seashell + the columbine subway + old back and knife
back over the river + spring wish + back in the family
deep winter— + + the old rose , + spring equinox
a long list : deep snow + the sound of the fog + right september starts + and splits day
harvest moon -- + the sound of a woodpecker - + hand ...
winter stars - + the sitting buddha + in the corner
passing cloud— + remembering + tortillas
winter morning - + a first garden + about over a book
summer traffic + your footprints of your eyes + long old + by sky
morning troubles + i remember the pot + back gloves
the mountains filled mountain rises + a white scent + of old mattress for + september fog
on the lawn + cry singing + as many flakes + long day
after the fog + the smell of blue lights + i faded geese
in the river bank + in the river runs + not a old gourd
abandoned playground -- - + some in the night runs + a happy can
friday silence - + a homeless man gathers cans + urban harvest
under the line + lifting fog + the window
