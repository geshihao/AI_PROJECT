first day of the fog + the bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the
the family , swathed + in only the other hand carries in the sky ...
the year veteran 's coat -- + a beach can see + the sky
summer heat + the crinkled edges + between heaven
the recession -- - + i find here - + one is over the moon
the farmer , + planting corn rise + a dragged christmas good â€™ s hand
harvest moon . . . . + a cell phone keeps shadow
equinox - + a grey day + over the bayou
in the stream 's hand + little bit of water + a butterfly is me the old words
sunrise -- - + the smell of crows + old timers + time looks light is thoughts
summer heat + the scars + inside barn
red sky- + the silence between us
the black woman + fog resting on old + migrating change
summer heat + the scars + campfire fog at the sunshine
the stream couple + a little salt + in the moon
a soda can + old woman gathers + for a passing cloud
cutting snow clouds - + the widow eats his + a hint of the scent the garden
cold rain + i red over the stream + without a towel
a lake + feeling the cordite day moon + heavy with green + over the wall
a soda can + old woman + more time . shadow
the a door river -- - + the smell of moon + all day
sunday snow - + the rose , + a crocus falls
she looks at the river -- - . + the smell of a loon shatters + the garbage can
cold moon - + a three-legged + on lake
summer heat + a couple eye half moon + to the red air
( moon - + running in the way burning you at the scent + of the sun
mango flavoured tea + thoughts on the moon
moving the + the old woman + old memories
a lake + carving + deep blue sky ... + early
steady snow + the lingering scent + of a snow
the moon - + all the heat fills the windows + old is back
cold sky -- - + the barmaid kisses me + in the river 's old north
