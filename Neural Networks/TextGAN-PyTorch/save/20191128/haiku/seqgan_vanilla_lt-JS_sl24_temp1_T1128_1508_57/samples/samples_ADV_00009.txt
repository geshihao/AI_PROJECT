stifling heat -- - + the barmaid kisses something + in the rain
a final date -- + mingling their ashes + she to me me
august wind + a long pause + of the wall
pale moon + the ring of the home + she cleans her window screen
as one rain -- - + she 's weight + in the mist
it - + the snowflakes + again
a light + at the roofs + a dollhouse
morning fog -- - + i remember to repeat + what no path
summer garden full + darkness + of a bottle ’ s cracked
cold winter day - + hot stop + back to reveal river
do snow + a church starts + into a haiku
summer rain - + still the old eyes + on my teabag
sunday rain - + the ligustrum tree + a scurry of land
snow and melting + white lillies in a taste of rain
unhurried + she looks at me + in the mist
migrating cranes + the house across the + watching the same lights
a jar of pennies + on a parking sake cloud ...
amidst the chimneys + goes colder + in the campfire
a ladder leans + at every air + lingers on heavy home
holy land + the pioneers left no old + for vespers
new moon -- + the sound of wings + bleed in yesterday
behind the bag + finds the cemetery + bisected visible
from the suite dusk + along the snow fills + in my neighbor breaker + the winter dust
falling leaves— + all the graffiti + into mist
grey day + a white cat + glistening with syrup + chilled to bloom
old friends . . . . + soft moon in a raindrop + as falling moon
new time + until a bloomed wheel
the ides of car + only the crumbling leaves ; + even down
puffs of frosty bare pair of day + blooming before + two conversations
the offering + leaf - + morning moon
leaves cold - + a woodpecker + goes only
three 's 18th birthday -- + her countdown to christmas + pint of snow
