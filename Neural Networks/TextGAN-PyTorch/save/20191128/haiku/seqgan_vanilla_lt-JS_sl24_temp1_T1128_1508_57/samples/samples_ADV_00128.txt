the breeze + where the fluttering + in the mist
rain settles + the old woman , despite + the ticking old gate
wind chime + opening tea outside + i in the fog
tropical snow -- - + the drop of snow + turn traffic a wake grey
old love letter + comes back talk + in the darkness
a few home + her lipstick + the ache swats the the name
first day of summer + soft with snow + of a blue plate
failing light . . . + i remember the incense stick love + over the moon
winter day day -- - + the rose , greening + the mountain notch
a furniture store - + i stand to the snow + old tune out
i long day -- - + the blue heron + at me
in the fog -- - + a gray sweater , + the tree
december rain - + the rose , greening
a furniture store + each other dusk ... + the autumn day moon
autumn equinox - + the old tea + into way falling
moon gazing + the slice me is i find + the homeless man at s steps
the old short coat + over the cobweb + of a red high . . . . . . . . . day the
thunderstorm -- + the pow-wow— spot + the last blossoms
rainy day -- - + from the garden , half moon , + the road 's old back and snow
the sidewalk + at the lawn + the last page . is the end
rainy day -- - + last time + she to me + in the vase
a final date -- + a mouse between the + forest runs .
the blank page + learning nothing + snow on the last + is the old gourd
the empty nest + over the end + a crinkled latches the gate you + then light
a lake + feeling the twinkle + along the branch me + from the compartment
a dried lotus leaf + is naked
your perfume— + green tips of tea + old touch me
the sidewalk eclipse + in the spent branch fog + the tree
the old town - + she takes wearing the fog + not sharing the book + over the sky
rainy dawn and the moon + the few dewdrops on + a homeless man gathers cans + plum 's shouthers
the light of + raindrops on the + nobody after the incense shadow
a lake + feeling the fingerprints i + snail is the whole life - + thoughts on the moon
