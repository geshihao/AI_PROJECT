all day -- - + the old garden + on the free nails the `` chemo
the door : + the muzzle of the home + i do the center
deep summer - + the red rose + falling snow
a soda can + + of the river bank + in the family star
sunday fog at the cove + the way in the blue lingering + still cool old + to the hand
a lake + feeling the shopkeeper + tells a mackerel sky ... + house , this side
morning fog -- - + the cat to light out + from a far-away land
he looks up + over the last blossoms + old memories
summer fog -- - + the old love + unknot
the moon - + all the fog , the scent + of the way light
autumn day -- - + the red rose + at the window , the window
old love letter . . + the old man 's voice she is the funeral
a final + trembling a red + thunder , a loon 's reply i fog
a lake + feeling the sweetness + a hint of the + fisherman , then + who i koi day
wedding day - + even the heat + of your own prints passed
the old path + over the early + cherry petals at the + running in snow is the moon
after the cloudburst + a man standing beneath the shadow + thoughts of fog
the family gatheredâ€” + a last world in the + lighting bugs , the last morning
a garden buddha -- - + as the warmth of the forest + a red bicycle
thousands of the twelve-carriage platform + blue blue sky -- - + to the incense shadow
behind the summer -- - + she 's only + in the wind
a soda can + as iraq . . . . . . . . + on the last sky
croton hedges + with every grey cane + near the family book
the seasons change + with the dock , her eyes ... + as i put on the way back
summer fog + pallets of wings + back to pigeons
january sun ... + tea with us + over the way + heavy a door
a requiem + only you done i buried + the moon
a few notes + for the windharp the bloom to the gate + in the door , a address , + unforeseen prints +
cold moon -- - + i find the last cold + is a half moon
winter rain -- - + the garden crows + as the syringe
grey day + the river bank + the gray scent of falling + rose scented old back
i long june day -- - + the sound of the end + the lingering mist
