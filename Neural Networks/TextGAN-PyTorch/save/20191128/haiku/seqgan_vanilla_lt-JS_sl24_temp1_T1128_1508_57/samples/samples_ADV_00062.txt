summer heat + a mantle of snow + a deeper , sky
the wind of + all the wind + the whole world
summer fog -- - + she asks if she passes me + with the hotel soap
summer 's end + the sharpness in + only the sky
a few petals + where i walk into the sky + on bare sun
spring evening - + all the end of the pollution -- + i wake + butterfly grows
the breeze + settles falling road + in the fog
the sound + far away of the bed + the child 's shadow + to a house
east river high ’ s hat + the smell of a red tears + a tunnel of snow
winter evening + a end moon - + a blackbird says the table
the farmer , + planting corn under + the moon
winter evening + a few blocks closer + than his book : + a list of open
charcoal alley— + us in the way + by her voice
summer heat + a few dewdrops on display + she waits
summer carnival -- - + the grey woman + undone
snow turns over the bed - + the sound of the mist + and winter
winter evening . . . . . . . i + back with bird-song + to meet the ice
a rose garden + for the light of summer + + i share the mist
forgetting back ... + the old air + supporting the wind
august wind + a deep train early + on a closed
winter rain + a cloud passes + a same pot
crescent moon - + deep into the old + of old pond
on lake gift + the grey patch + old shoes
an old lady called mary + on the middle of the way + and winter moon
way back home + a tenderness + of moon
invisible on + clouds appear + a silk sound
winter night + the barber appears + in the family book
maws fecht ower the bucket + scent of rain + a calling of his cadence + fog
summer sky . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
winter wind— + fluttering + then we put a helmut of snow + deep across the tunnel
traffic back + a steaming stick + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . deep footprints
summer heat + a love cup + the lullaby
