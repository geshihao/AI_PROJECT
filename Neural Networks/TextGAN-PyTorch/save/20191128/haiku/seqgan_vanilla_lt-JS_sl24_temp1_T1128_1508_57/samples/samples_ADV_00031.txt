december the wind + a blue teapot birds drift + to the ceremony
autumn mist + purple rhododendrons + dissolve back and back
winter park - + an awful truth cream + s whole colour + looks snow
young lovers + a white platform bank + still bubbles + in the cleaning + old song
summer sidewalk - + i wish me + in the moon
rosebud unfolding + and a harvest moon + falling geese
gibbous moon -- + the final + mortgage payment
coming out of the wood + the scent of a blue sky . deep + summer heat
out of the morning + only warm on + fog horns
summer evening - + the lingering scent + of a harvest moon
a soda can + at the left + soften her red
clouds gather + i trace my toe in a loon + spring shower
a hawk searches + the way in the floor + of the table , + spring equinox
freight train -- - + the last whistle of + with many stars
summer heat + the photo of her heels ... + .
november blossom -- + she starts store + we stand the wind
back porch + at the river bank + climbing the last day
the blank page + learning to find + a new-born calf
half moon . . . . + back and bird-song + in the wind
rush hour traffic + on the mountain notch + in the sky
after the stroke . . . + her diamond on her bare hand + in sound -- - + is a cold moon
summer fog -- - + the cat watches + light the tunnel
summer sidewalk - + the warmth + as the moon
a pagoda + in the darkness + of loneliness
half asleep - + winter shadows between + left standing
red poppies ... . . . + on the face to + he passes through
wearing a shoebox + she 's warmth + only graves in the fog
end of summer -- + the new barber is summer + summer day ...
a dry maple leaf + end of fertilizer + at the bar -- - + with the wind
a soda can + shot woman i left a raindrop + as the table
summer day 's balloons - + he remembers + that silence
a soda can + of falling leaves circle + one in the moon
