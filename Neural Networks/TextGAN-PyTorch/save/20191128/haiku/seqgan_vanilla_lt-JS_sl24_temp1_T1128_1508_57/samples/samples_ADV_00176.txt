a final + been flies are + a snail 's red -- - + old hunting shirt
- the cloudburst + old wish , + in conversation
approaching the light . . . + i the blue sky— + the sweet old home
after the ruins + in the trench + how the old pond
tea home + i nothing in the day + old memories
cold moon - + the old graffiti looks + at me
snow over -- - + i nothing in the train + is a passing cloud
a lake + feeling the sunshine i call to i ... + the blue lingering + back to fix + over passing grey
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + i among a hospital garden
a final + enlightenment ... + the hammock ropes i is a half moon + falling moon
a few louder + the cormorant + dives
the brush + hot on the incense stick love + old friends
a lake + halfway ? and a red sky- + the train runs ahead
the snow filled in the branch + as the avalanche rest , that donkey in ... , + in the family garden
the old line + in the last blossoms + from the last is a dock
a lake + feeling the shopkeeper + locked and loaded break + the train is a snow , the moon
on the hospital + + as lean woman says the + over the warmth
a lake + feeling the king i eyes + thoughts shaping and + all the window , the table , + july moon
winter fog -- - + she looks out + in the bottom of the hands
winter day day -- - + the smell of blue a + still wind
in the moon + change time . . . . + old back and day
the tall pines + a daffodil left + in the family garden
cold rain + a diamond gathers + out the corner
the sunrise + at farm the day + in a church . .
a few leaves the door -- - + the last world is the window sill + a temple
summer ’ s day , walk , the scent + of this snow wave ... + the fog
month-old obit + blue jeans -- - + your day after + fog the old thoughts
a lake -- + the sound of the window + at the fog
autumn deepens + the garden is me , the last + back with a bug + red touch
the thanksgiving meal - + starts might petals + why fills the last blossoms + old back and a grey
summer fog + up up the moon , a train whiskey + over the mist
unkind words + the mother 's wife + the cold window + the pond in the a house
