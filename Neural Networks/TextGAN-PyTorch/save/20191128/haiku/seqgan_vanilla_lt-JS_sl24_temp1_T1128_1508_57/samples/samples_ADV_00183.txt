morning fog -- - + she smiles at me + lifting fog the window
steaming tea + sells wish the last + in every direction
winter day day -- - + i over the garden bush + a calm harvest
spring day + . . . shadow + i thoughts the early sky
old love letter + the barber is + in the last sky
morning fog -- - + she looks out + in the river 's shadow
teeth in the day + thoughts of crows + thoughts of coffee -- -
winter day day -- - + the last whistle , a fish she in the forest + falling home
in the river -- - + i walk i remains - the old back
night shift - + i and i take i take up the slice + the pond 's window
summer in + etched in snow is the pond + moon
vigil + bay and islands in fog , the forest + a half moon
summer fog + pallets of heavy snow + in the sky
dark marks . . . + even i walk are
at the day -- - + one spot in i find + the train evening
slipping in + as the canyon bath old + back and a tulip
a flurry of the we kick , the old love + as the fried love story ... + old deck chair
a long list chasing + only the last to pronounce + as + as the coming goes into grey
i umbrella day -- - + the old empty can + turns over the old warmth
first day of the moon , i thoughts + the red runs + even the thatch
after the hospital + red break in the day , then river
a passengers waves + on the way i among the + snow and back , this autumn moon
i umbrella day -- - + i deep in the fog -- - + the summer day
summer 's day -- - + two unattended dove eggs + to a hotel soap
the ides of wind + a dawn reaches of the sky starts + i water
rain - + the last child drops at the + clouds appear + on her sharp and tulip
full moon . . . i + red wish + over date + rising
a absinthe for the sun -- - + the smell of a moor + reaches of fog
deep fog + the moth circles + the cormorant â€™ s cracked sale open
grey day -- - + i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the only green hour + the fluttering of sky + old back
morning fog -- - + the end of the red line - + the window , the bed
