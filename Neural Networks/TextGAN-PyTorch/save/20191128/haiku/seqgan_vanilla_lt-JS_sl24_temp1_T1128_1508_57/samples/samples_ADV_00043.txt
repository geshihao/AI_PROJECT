cherry blossoms + a memory of little more back + thoughts of mist
deep summer - + the mime runs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
summer heat + a carriage stands + chalk mark wall + sitting
the name + i he doing flutter + + with snow
summer heat + the dragonfly lands + spring dreaming
summer ’ s end + ... horses browse + through the + streetlight reflections
the courtship songs + in the coffee blows + this autumn rain
summer heat + a homeless man gathers cans + urban harvest all
honeymoon + warmth of the begging monk + as burn brightly
summer garden tracks + a blue sky— + the moon
half moon . . . . + a little new way + in the snow
cold moon -- + a asphalt harvest 's been + butterflies
oh time . . . + back with bird-song + and spring
early morning snow + something + smiles at the border + silt
winter - + red is tiny rainbow + with our tears + just a touch
autumn chill - + a homeless veteran 's blade + midsummer - + brightly silence
autumn twilight - + stars appear + the spruce stood
cloud moon ... + the wedding passes + a helmut of mist
both feet slide + at the way across + a helmut of way back
steady spring day + dreams with light + at the end of the world
spring day - + all the moon + in heavy a tulip
beyond + we talk of lilacs
my day of sale , + with the rain gathers + and warm old tombstones
the age + we slip to red + on the air
half moon -- + the icicle + hand or old + to a chill of old red
long sunday morning - + early in a full moon + deep dreaming
the whistle of fog + ... nothing + into the mountain web
early march -- - + a new garden ice + on the map
delta blues ... + the silence + at guantanamo warmth
first firefly . . . . + a smell of a oak + eyes
bits of + halfway and one more + for me another
november moon ... + a yogi does + a occasional of sea + a dragged christmas sky
