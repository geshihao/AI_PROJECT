winter - + a yogi does i + on the rising
autumn snow -- - + she looks at me + and a foggy sky
winter drags . . . . + a early blossoms + never came back into a address
aged painter ~ + trembling a + only pounding snow
the blank page + learning to pronounce + - + with her gate
a lake + carving + sound of something + of the moon
i brush + the smell of old tears + the moon
libya - + rose sky- + the old violin goes + to a ancient
ruined owl chair + as a blue heron + at me
final approach - + as the carpenter open + it , to me + in the moon
homeless breeze + all the bath rest else
more rain - + the red runs + old memories
lunch winds + i remember the pane + frozen into hand
the old woman , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
desert glare + we talk of saffron + at the mist
she home : + i find the light + in the train
morning fog -- - + a end of the roof + between burning home
a rose sign + at a raptor + the old shoes
rainy dawn -- - + a red heels + the last day
she looks home + a cormorant + dives
summer heat + a line the boy friend , + near the line of grey
daylight sky -- - + i oak else + heat
suddenly + a flock of insects + fog
winter solstice + the church ... + in the life 's + for snow
a soda can + this cherry blossoms and sky - + thoughts of the tunnel
windy moon + the drone of lilacs is + the old gourd
haiku potato chips + nobody can write + on the wind
crowded subway -- - + the sound of one + looking + with rain
summer sky -- - + i head out + wrapped all day
at the day - + a goose honks its way + keeps the door
unexpected guest- + a carriage shark + on the page
the family gatheredâ€” + a sound of + long before + thoughts on
