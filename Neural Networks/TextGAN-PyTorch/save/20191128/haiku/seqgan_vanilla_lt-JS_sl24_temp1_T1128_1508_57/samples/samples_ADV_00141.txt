the old lights - + in the long way + as a loon light
the old love - + far smiles i left the + lighting crusted snow
rainbows reflected + in the cherry blossom is + the rose , late + in the moon
cloudless sky -- - + she has us + the crescent moon
december wind - + in the river bank + me is a tulip
back over the day + after the summer day + to the sea water + over the bed
i long day - + the last open + old memories
end ... + the moon passes the + running all postures
on the hospital + even back over the scent + of the last open me
zazen - + all the red faces are + last night of a grey sky
a soda can + + of the cherry blossoms , + in the blue door
i umbrella i . . . + this plum blossoms + hospice window the
the year veteran 's feet + over date + is a reek of decaf snow at snow + over the bed
dark wind are day + the barber is + in the sparrows
with the river -- - + she looks out + the blackbird 's been sober
snow over the ink -- + the sound of snow + then river
day moon - + the smell of blue light + she 's whole window
a walk sunday smell + she 's warmth + right our hand ...
half the armoire , + last year , flies back is + in the family garden
silver thunder , the tea + long love + over the way + old memories
autumn mist + the scars + umbrella moon
autumn chill - + a magpie turns at the year
honking through the last night + the silence between the wind + the child 's time
the old man says ... + the rose , leaden love + falling leaves old gate
a soft circles of a kid + tells me is i take , + the old gourd
dark old summer -- - + she has us + the pond in the day 's weight
snow furyâ€” + the old woman , out of the loon - + over the incense
alone over the fog + home , a loon shatters + the mountain notch
harvest moon -- - + i i and a few leaves flutter + is time
falling mist + red sky- + over the last back + empty evening
summer heat + the gravedigger latches the alley + i a snail 's eyes
summer heat + the company 's + plum is i deck chair
