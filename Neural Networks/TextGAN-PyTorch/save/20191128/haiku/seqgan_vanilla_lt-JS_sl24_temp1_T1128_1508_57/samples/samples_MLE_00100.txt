the noir + of the sun + on bare address
spring day + . . . . are train is rising seaweed + painted
cherry blossom road -- - + she asks out the oncologist + needs side
april , swathed + of fried silver out to fix + lock of steam tan
squash vines + cordite ink - + not their cold
after the darkness + hot shiver of our weeks + rising clouds
side before home + a young deer + needs a nipple
november day + i notice roommate— + a skunk 's warning
a moth flies + as i ask cry she wears her hair + after picking it
no escaping + this moonlight— + pompeii
middle of summer solstice + do n't chase + the morning tea too + into the text
up my office + only the dry leaf + for the pavement
saturday night window ' truck clerk + for a building site 's mud wall + wintering over
old sandbox + he marvels + out of reach
cold snap + all the end of a single leaf + this late evenings
on my smartphone + mount fuji in a fog + on a land
after some the grass + of courting birds
the owl 's daughter + plugging in a train in + wind-puffed primroses
overcast light + a old abandoned tombstone + burns higher
struggling from + the train in a blotter + topless
drought + another new sky + winter rain
new driver -- + another conversation + about my shirt
naked light on + suddenly what it rains rain + that grandchild
window date . . . + i buy + april rain
the moon + brush through the apple + out of side
cool breeze -- + awakened the laundry + sorted by mothers
homeless breeze + opens at cards ? and
summer rain ... + long warriors + in the coffee cup
crescent moon -- - + the flight of love + on the lawn 's backside
courtyard of the shrine + the asphalt road + mother in the valley
wood knot + in the cemetery + a thin bar
cherry silence - + a tremble of love , + in a valentine fat class
