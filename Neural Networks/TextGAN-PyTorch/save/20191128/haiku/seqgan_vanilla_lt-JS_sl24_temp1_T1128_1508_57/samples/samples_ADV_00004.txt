autumn leaves + my office car + song 's end + the dollhouse
a construction site + on the friend 's eyes + and spring
late sipping path + the sudden night + a lizard on the home
snow furyâ€” + the way three tears off + the church net
in the end + of a rain of dawn -- - + a single magpie
old day + fading monutains + dead after picking it
incoming fog + the train passes ... + near the warmth
that before dawn . . . + how brittle his full + lighting bugs
sharp winter moon + her tombstone + to the ocean deep footprints
midnight . . . + some make my windows + in the ice breaker
hiroshima day + i leave behind + another contraction
summer ends- + just the stones + for new year 's route
apples cooking : + warmth of the wall + fishing boats come
winter stars - + a yogi pisses + in a loon ice ?
spring snow -- - + my place + veils our chairs + on his underwear
falling fog + ... long forget + in the passengers
a familar name + and a blue heron + effaced by shadow
among the moon + nobody changes + turns a harmonica
rush hour + we take the same leaves + thoughts of lunar
alone + in the treetops + highway
the age + i wake new year + from so much for a stain
first snow -- + the cat alone to settle + at the hardware store
with the night -- + the hill new way + smiles up only
overcast + until heavy year + field of scotch
good sunday breeze - + my man on her red + stopped another
soba noodles . . . + all neighborhoods share + the slow tick interrupted
old news + a bus rumbles -- + a faint essence to light
summer heat + my brother hammers house + is a cold afternoon
snow in the forecast -- - + a cat alone to silver + above the autumn mist
fresh snow -- + the moon dances + in the compartment
when celsius + and sea air + silence on the bayou
fall morning + dreams of an wall + in the mist
