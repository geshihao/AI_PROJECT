no moisture + long dream in the sky + seventy-eights
foggy glasses . . . + the murmuring man war speaks + the fog up
hunter 's door + after loving-making in + hospice church .
subway wind + still over her grave + accroche seeds
middle of ash fan + at my cloud for earth + north rest
all piercing + a new graffiti tries + yellow butterfly
move + in the cold moon + ... bloom
old date + my axe drop of + over my fear
enlightment -- + no butterflies and + homeless trail behind
red year— something -- + another scent + of whipped cream
side of barefoot , swathed + what they remember + of my thoughts
lingering sunday + the smell 's words + your apple
rocking the hill + the refrigerator + fractured night wave
crossing a produce remover bed + the colours of + the old state breaths
flowing estuary + watching the fire chair
september air date -- + are trembling tree + with the poem
circling each hammer + i watch her lftover + without shepherd
cold night + a cold rain + the fridgidaire
four need floats + a front button me i left + against the petals
right back falling + the street dog ~ + the old woman
cold wildflowers + the old violin goes + kite festival
hot dreaming + he marvels + in a coffin + yet by light
starry night + two maple in that apple + on our call on wall
story + enters my death + this third juice
stopping + this fog patter + the politics
the way to be ... + scent of smoke + still eating the first day
standing stock-still ~ + the nighthawk cries so telling + the thin moon
morning piercing + a fridge looks up + on the bruises
with thunder sesshin + new rise out + of the road wisp
windy day + each graffiti -- + wasting away
falling leaves— + i finally i have you . .
month-old obit + of wet came in the book clouds
