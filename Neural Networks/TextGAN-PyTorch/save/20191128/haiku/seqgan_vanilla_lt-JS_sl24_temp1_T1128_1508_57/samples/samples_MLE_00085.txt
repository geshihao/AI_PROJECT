hunter 's day + a harmonica + train chill
along the books + the graffiti + memorial leaves all
finally a construction silently + the cathedral crowd + convicts shoot the car 's tree
windy day + fog resting on cedars + over a carp
reflecting + the water to wonder she wears + the evening address
cold rain + darkness again — + still uncarved
first snow -- + splitting + the moon also shows + falls from a bath
kumquats with russian day + words + now keeps an faces out ... + for a snowflake
madison square park -- - + cracks of a new grandchild + zealously
heat wave + the smoke + fades in a silver + arrows south
efficiency hedges + is frozen roar of moonless night
freeze warning -- + a retirement card + dusk 's reply
moon-paved road + from the night leaf + fireflies
saturday fireworks - + and that donkey 's braying + still in the fridge
open suitcase ~ + the house fills the sand + are still soft
ash wednesday -- + snowflakes settle + on the ice
hundreds of + field of cut marks + a diamond earing
in the winnock + an egret walks eyes + and slow soft
a float plane + divides the rough + not meet
tombstones + tightening each other + mist
snowmelt . . . + same early tick + windy day
at dead needs + close
frosty mention + at twilight— + the dialysis center
spring mist + the magpie are walk
valentine 's day - + no old pass for earth + darker
holding the night -- + the wind pushes + among my sick red
cold snap -- + the scent of sandpiper splits + even down
remembering from shore + lifting + the wall of way
a quiet + cleaning cares we take shelter -- + rising
good friday -- + layers of tune drift + to moonlight
walden pond -- + the patch of sand , + from the migrant 's fountain
migratory pelicans ... + copper wishes collect + in the windscreen
