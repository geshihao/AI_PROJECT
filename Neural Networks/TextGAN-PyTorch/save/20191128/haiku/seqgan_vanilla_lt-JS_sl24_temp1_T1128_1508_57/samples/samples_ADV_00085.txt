nothing + in the end + the smell of + of a harvest moon
december heat - + the wind blows + thoughts of warm
summer heat + a desk clerk + bursts at the darkness + old shoes
a things each sip + at the bed + all the moon
winter stars - + a still in only + by a tanning salon
red lobster- + each wearing i + reading time . . . + new rain
crossing the storm ... + ... how snow falls + over the bayou
prayers + for lingering day + on my prayers + are unfair
the old end ... + the barber can here and wind -- - + time
summer storm . . . shadow + blossoming in the clouds : + for warm a wall
red sky- + a snail crawls watching the red + into moon
rainy spring day + suddenly slowly i as i + voices in snow
early spring day . . . day + a magpie turns into the fog
sunday morning fog + ... horses browse + the intersection
a maple needs + unpacking winter rain + the spring day
summer longing + a maw snuves + flirts with home
squash vines + across the stars + the red flag
the spider 's + spring again + back to the ceremony
on office snap -- - + a snail crawls up the + on the green hot in + i wake + winter fog
memories + at the space passes - + are i burn them - + are
in the dishes - + scent of a blue sky + rain
the old path + a honeybee lingers + in the wind
sunday morning blue fog -- - + our kitchen walls + for the orange
rain - + the cat turns shadow i + the winter air
the old town + old wish + on the fresh train + is spring equinox
train whistle + someone is despite + a lock of butterflies
divorce talk + the blooming graffiti + takes curtains runs
home — + she dreams of + snail turns a break + on the darkness
the moon— + the respirator carries on + deep back
summer 's day , . . . . ... + one in the song + next to a subprime crisis
end ... + the persistent warmth + of the incense stick out
winter rain -- + a little mountains + in my valley
