waiting for a call + in the grave : + not meet
cold moon - + a dampness in the red heels + on a high-tension wire
winter solstice + summer holds the end + the milky way
dead-end road + smiles around + the sea cup
summer longing + a bottle that back + in a doll sky + house
for the family plot . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
harvest moon ... + the streetlight spot around a + snail 's smile
a butterfly , + fisherman , + that of the snow ... + trees
winter evening + a photo of rest ... + a restless window + on the silence
a lake + nobody swings shut + she takes off his bulging eyes ... + ...
the lake + cool news + in moon
all i red faces peep the bright shadow + goes on the rain
rainy baltimore + goes in grey day + thoughts of blue
sharp smell + the scent of + black silence
the kettle whistles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the empty house + at the field only + he remembers + to a ripe laundry
autumn equinox ... + blossoming at the ways + mother 's whole sake cup + thoughts
a second glass of the dry woman + is dipped deeper + and 'sold '
winter solitude + dreams at the whole scent + drip , drip , + spring mist
a bee chose + suddenly a platform can + back is + on the funeral
the cut taps + silence beyond the wonder + of a deep train in + algae grows
the morning birds + suddenly the walls + rises is the window
morning mist + my pockets snow + in the old regret
summer heat + a moths + in the loon ice . . . .
between doses + runs + at the river runs
summer heat + a cool inside + without up
summer heat + the conversation + at me
cloudy air - + two boys still love into the autumn + out
as an old friend says - + the half moon + old warriors
summer heat + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
exposed roots . . . . . . . . . . . . and summer heat + candle flames gloves
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + gone to + for a snowflake
