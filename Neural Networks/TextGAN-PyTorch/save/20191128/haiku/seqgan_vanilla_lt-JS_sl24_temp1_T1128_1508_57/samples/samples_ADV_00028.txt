the rail ' + on unfinished + back to me
do snow + the cry of the first back + in her hips
in silence - + a balloon moves + in her hands
among the candelabra + of the ruins + of the bride 's laughter
a photo + on mom + end wave
i brush + the scent + of mothballs
fourth wave -- - + the evening wind -- - + in the sky
a dragonfly pines + find + the columbine still + back into moon
summer â€™ frogs + ... + a homeless veteran 's blade is cracked
the morning sun - + a teakettle + umbrella + again
summer rain ... + two passengers clung + red touch
alone on the taste + in morning tea ... + thoughts
tea trees - + in the corners of moon + slow to shadow
a furniture store + where i passed + with a tea garden
waiting for the branch - + back and forth on + river the hairs
summer blue sky -- - + a oak tree + long back + in the wall cloud
wind chime + too many stones + never came back
melting snow - + with the soft moon + in a cloud
summer solstice + a contrail crosses + her shadow + are unfair
half moon . . . . + a greenfinch moves + in the hardware store
after the rain + the hammock ropes ; + the red onion + life alone
a absinthe for summer ... + but young cars + the summer moon + early
stars in the sky -- - + as we bronze turns out of + thoughts of fog
winter - + morning glories
summer 's end - + white wings and still ill + to breaks
a lights again + near the first bite + of the headlights
full moon -- - + the pregnancy test results + become clear
snow crocus + the christmas lights + she brings of home + on mine
summer evening + a bloomed peach tree ' shadow + fog for me
under the moon + the child 's marble bag bursts + without a cart along room
long i saw says it - + a few wind 's path + mother 's flight
winter evening + end of a mattress trees + a flat finish + on corrugated iron
