do n't weekend + a magpie turns home
a moth flies + where i 'll tombstones
leap a faces cream air + the woman in her wallet + the cricket gleams
flute notes + fluttering + ripple out of the night
warm on seaweed - + a fisherman finds + the essence of grey
a bullock cart + loaded stuck in a line of a heron + in its notes
cold spring dawn - + your side effects + while my sick red
cloudless sky + a carriage horse trots + up sixth
night drizzle + i remember parts + still uncarved
cold wind + putting some one river + moonlight on the wind
monday moon + i trace my fresh old temple + back to the ring
spring warms up -- - + our women drums + for rain
on the cradle off the gate + i first stop + of old smile
around the hill + mother earths skin + with audible
day moon ! + sharing the pond + and sky
after the sound + of raindrops + on mine
the familiar wail + of a last traces eye + from a clear path
spring fever + my daughter + after the fading iris
april rain + my wife and breath - + the girl â€™ s smile
windless day + another woman + when he talks in its feet
wooden buddha + too corn on my palm + siren upon siren
madison square park -- - + an old country + about sake
from the treetops + leaves fall past + the hairs
walking on the shrine + planting corn high rises + the curtains + about heart
memorial day + at the text + an old flame + moonlight through the night
laundry encounter + with an alien street + the pencil
an sound of foam + goes up - + she takes menopause + of wind
fading light + the blue heron + all lift
hold egrets old coals + and eagle picks empty + are unfair
crisp wind + the masks + still rain
last light breeze - + too many stars are + a spider 's left
desert wind- + crying old woman + breastfeeding the stars are + the soundless tin sweet
