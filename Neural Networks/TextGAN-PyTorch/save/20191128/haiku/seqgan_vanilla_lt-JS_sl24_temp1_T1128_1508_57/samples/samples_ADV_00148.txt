day moon -- - + the sound of the end + the old man tells me + in the mist
cracking walnut -- + a tear of snow + blue cold .
as i sleep ... + as i share the practice in grey sky ...
morning fog -- - + i even the old love + old memories
first day of summer day + thoughts in the monsoon + in the cold day moon
falling mist + the scars + umbrella sky
in the moon + the friend 's apple + goes for the old eyes
snow and it - + the old woman , gas and last + autumn day
after the cloudburst + summer moon is + in the passive voice
dark clouds -- - + through our be woman + without a glasses
train running summer + the cat , arc balloon + in the time
way back into the call to day , + the scent of tea + a man asks for you at + migrating , sweet
summer heat + the photo on the + pines of grey
heavy snow + the pond 's flight + along the rose
first day of the moon , the sunflowers , + in the barbed wire a grey
stifling heat -- - + the wall clock red + over the mirror
rainbows reflected + in old tea is + the her voice walks home
the blood earths truck truck aside + in homeless man gathers cans + break the
a lake + feeling the midnight ends + over the mail plane + finally the lake
rainy day -- - + the last blossoms + peach rain
cold moon - + the last enough + as the window sill + old back
the light of fog + the river bank + turns inside the + in silence
an old lady called mary + on the child 's last phrase only a platform + watched by the river runs
cafe more step over the fog , the lingering + back talk into the + terrorists
the way autumn rain - + the smell of old tears + a whiff of day
a soda can + old woman 's eyes ... + the evening love
back over the cloudburst + only the roses + old love + learning up
winter fog -- - + i nothing in the train + is a train whistle
a final + tap way a sky + a yogi does + the prison silence + the sun deepens the shadow
a lake + underlying sun - + the is sweet with a raindrop + as the old eyes
the old line + the child hammers browse + the lettuce
the family gatheredâ€” + a fallen leaf + falling home
