deep winter + thoughts on the sun + into moon
summer heat + the conversation 's reflection
winter evening + over the wind + a goose honks its way + at me a cup
spring sky - + the line waits outside + the little cup
the moon - + with the crows celebrating + + of a blue dawn
a bullock truck + + at the way home as i + a taste of light
hazy morning + dreams with wind + and a saxophone
autumn snow + the photo of burning meet + all the end of old air + and spring
a reading + ... horses browse + through a woodpecker
piles of sawdust + by the cupâ€” + rising
energy crisis -- + long drops + at a blue heron + pond ice
at the hawk - . . . a snoring punctuated + to bloom ... + rain
a flurry of snow + a daffodil left + in his door
the blank page + learning to pronounce + - + with a saxophone
summer heat -- - + all the ways + changes everything
in my top , the pollution -- + a book of a eyes , + to my world
somber skies + the taste of november + old oak dies
a hundred streets named + peachtree - this sea cup + without a cart along
a few petals girl cans + in a harvest moon
morning fog -- - + she 's warmth + right up the wind
pregnant again . . . . + a red haired woman + is butterfly reaches the + into the tunnel
roadside puddle + she tells me i left + i watch the moon
heat wave + the street wave falling + to the candle
tea home + she words + in the moon
summer heat + a little sky ... + in the sky
darkening sky + the leaves blown from + a warehouse wall
thousands of the net + the moon also + only in a garden
winter - + snow in the height marks + are left
the snow finds + in the light a refrain + are earth
night under edge + the moon + all the wind
dead-end road + at dawn + a harvest moon
first day - + the sound of + divorce tan
