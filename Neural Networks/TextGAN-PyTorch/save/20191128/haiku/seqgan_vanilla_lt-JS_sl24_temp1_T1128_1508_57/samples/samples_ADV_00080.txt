summer rain . . . . . . and fish + a pale moon + starry night
scudding clouds + a woman 's umbrella light
presidents ' weekend + blue snow 's + a rose
summer solstice + a half assembled shelves + he nails the bedroom
half moon - + she runs + and mine
winter rain + the way i back as november + a dragged christmas sky . is fish , + a fence
the click + of silence of a hot cup + to mist to a towel
sunday old stars . . . + the smell of a beach snow + the smell of heat
summer heat + the blue moon + on the family
winter clouds + mountains and ashes + into the night
under a house + at her tea bursts + a poster of old friend
morning sun + the her voice curtains + at night
winter stars - + a magpie goes into spring
this winter moon -- + the homeless veteran + amongst old pond + outside
first snow -- - + she has + a dollar bill first time
autumn wind + slant + put the scent of + old brick wall
stubbled fieldsâ€” + sale and + all the rain gathers + a daisy-chain
rainy night -- - + summer holds men + in the mist
morning fog -- - + she husband alone + the mirror
a soda can + drifts out + a flock of sand
after the bar -- - + as dipped tail + as he passes me
after the moon + a few spots of red + last morning snow
thunderstorm + a young mother + at me a land
august blue sky -- - + the barmaid kisses me + from a frog + thunder
summer longing + a long fingernails drum + with the rain of spring + again
rainy night -- - + two conversations + a mother 's cry
the seasons change + and parked cars + the whole family way + and spring
heavy rain - + the flies back away + without all day
summer heat + a thin crust of barn of mist + scatter with snow
autumn wind + a bright red air + over my way back
harvest moon ... + the leaf shadow . . . . . . . . . . + in the moon
green rimmed + overgrown with the world + on the lawn
