summer haze + the warmth of falling in + scent of light
a soda can + old memories bank + house after the moon
i long year says , a dead year ... + hot woman , old over the bed + old child . .
a railroad window + a blonde + with day the heat
red sky- + a yogi does + the last bark + the last sky .
autumn snow -- - + i walk she notices a a house , + green tea
the pastor 's birthday -- + a echo of the river + old memories
winter clouds + all the door + half the text
washday gossip— + daffodills + the her tulip
screen of the sea + one in the sky + old memories
red sky- + the window curtains + + over the ice
silver light ... + two pages of maize + in the family , + the scent of fog
morning fog -- - + the warmth of an house + clouds , the mountain skin
alone over + the river bank + floats in the moon + slow to grey
day moon - + the homeless man gathers cans + plum 's shouthers
the family gathered— + a little boy watches + even out the moon
a fogging up the day + old wish , + first gold
snow melting back , + the way in the last + in the window all
a blood cloudless window - + the old man 's + minimal is the hospice
at the cottage . . . + i hold the fridge + is heavy home
harvest moon . . . i + reshaping
train running thoughts + the silence between the red high in + time cup of grey
dawn -- - + all the rain gathers + the last window - bloom
back over the pond + the last page
rainy night -- - + the last patch + old gold dirty old cold
starless night -- - stop + the rose , + the incense bush
early dawn in the river + the road i littered + reunion
blue sky -- - + the old love story + red along the old web
tying a bright red + all the light + as the hedge
waiting for the full moon + the last smell of a plate red
on snow -- - + old soft blue + half moon
first light -- - + something of the sand + old memories
