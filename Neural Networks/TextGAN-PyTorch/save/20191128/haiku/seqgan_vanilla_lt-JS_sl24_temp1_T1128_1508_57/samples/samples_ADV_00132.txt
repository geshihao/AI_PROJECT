winter day day -- - + your smile the window + the last blossoms
abandoned store— + over the mountain notch + old man
the sound of green house + at the edge + a puff of snow + in the toilet bowl
cold moon - + the last friend 's left + in the window
a lake + halfway ? , her + in the grand piano + winter night
behind the river + the smell of rain + the child 's end a rose
fog in the day + over the morning light + to the snow
deep september + the fog has + in the river
a long stories + two crows oak , . . . . . . . bloom + the window-cleaner 's blade
early day + the day pauses + a whiff of day
heavy snow + the smell of rain + on the hotel soap
the family gathered— + old woman 's + a all dawn
a lake + feeling the mardi meet date + ... the window + early spring
the debt ceiling will snow . . . . shadow + old butterfly
running you - + the scent of + neighbor and the window , red mile .
deep winter + we blow , . . . + a cigarette butt
a window frames her + the way in the family me + the river of the bed
the returning running home + the river bank + home i boyfriend
the small cloudless gate + of the cherry blossom + + the window-cleaner 's blade
morning fog over -- - + as the family me + in the way
new moon -- + the sound of the hot light + in the past tense
the windscreen post window + the ligustrum tree + the old gourd
the path of day + the sunflowers -- - + the fountain
summer fog + in the ink + the dog-rose falling drifts + early
blue sky -- - + the cold moon + the plum light
autumn blue sky -- + the garden crows + as the goldenrod
just friends — + we talk of water + into the umbrella . .
as i do the sunflowers -- - + the old couple + steady lingering night
day moon - + with the old woman + old shoes
autumn mist ... + thoughts shaping and + neighbor and closes the red + to time
industrial decay -- - + the sound of the red over + fog horns
summer chill - + in the top with wild fields + at the mist
