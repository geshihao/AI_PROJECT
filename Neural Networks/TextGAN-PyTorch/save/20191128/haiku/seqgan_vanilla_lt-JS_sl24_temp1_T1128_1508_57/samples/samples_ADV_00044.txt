autumn maple + home appear + the patio looks at + its cup
waiting for a hawk - + the garden seeds drift room + the bug lights
a quiet train ~ + a decade has twenty -- + just out
a walk has i ' bed + a blue sky above + the essence of old ripple
deep fog + you drifts + winter moon
the day hides . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i remember
summer in + again + just love down red
as i remember + talk of stars + on the red
sampling the wind + a plane asks + ... flower garden
the sound + of heat , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
a white pregnant daughter + across the way to pronounce + through the + thoughts
equinox - + the moon is + all the winter darkness
sudden sun + through our eyes - + the pond light
a furniture store gathers + something gathers + the same question does , a stranger
harvest moon . . . . . . . a maw snuves + trout once
summer heat + the yellow train + half a mirror
the family gathered— + a weather turns air + day fog
harvest moon . . . . . . . deep back and + only the flower + back and kiss
musty smell + fireworks away too + thoughts of old
on lake gift + all the grey warmth + almost a mile ago
move - + the real iris heads tonight + red to the line
snow flurries - + a goose honks up + along its way + without time
winter traffic + even you her voice + young deer garden
ring around the sun + with the dry grass -- - + a little shorter
midnight + the cricket and words + more rings than saturn
emptied fountain + carried in the gate + in a blue pot
the walking at day + of the edge of the call + in an old red
awoken at 4 am + a carnelian red tea + rose out
winter drags on . . . . ... + in the pasta bowl
a dull ache i laughter -- + the world is + in a garbage truck + half moon
weaving the old bed - + a diamond has + the driver ’ s shadow
summer steps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... + a baby 's + suddenly
