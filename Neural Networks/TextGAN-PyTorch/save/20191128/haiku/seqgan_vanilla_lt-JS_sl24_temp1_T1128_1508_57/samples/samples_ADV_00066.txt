train window + the landscape coming + before moon
amid summer + a magpie + monochrome
cool morning news -- - + i and i pass a half + brightening ice lingering
a moth flies + all the way + along a loon 's howl winter +
letting the branch come and go hunting + a sweet family , + the cloud-smudged sky
dusk - + a harvest runs + mist
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + with our breath
summer heat + a butterfly , bright a + lingers on beam
no a waitress + the distinctive grey used + at the rain
scattering snow of the red leaf , + the old quiet + out of day
a walk of summer rain + a shooting star + across the garden
the recession -- - + i just time + a steam cooking
back over the cloudburst + scent of the ruins + of a misty sky
frosty night . . . . + fallen playing deep mountain ridge + back
harvest moon + the rose passes + the scent of light
five star hotel - + a reek of burnt leaves sand
after summer rain + the man standing outside + the silence between shadow
summer morning + even out the love + one is back
autumn snow + the photo of each son + reading a life up + to the mist
rainy spring day + something + at the rainbow + of falling leaves
snow and cars + the dawn i wind + the lake of snow
my daughter deep cold + the morning sun + a three-legged + waits
winter stars - + a homeless man gathers cans + urban harvest
frozen pond . . . + soft ridges of snow is + with many angels
alphabet soup - + a bottle wave gathers + and one silver and the hardware store
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + in a bath ice
winter morning + finding spray + in the moon
leap year - + i freckles outside + the train runs
at the hospital + she i wears a cat warms goes + into snow
thousands of the twelve-carriage platform + outside is a cadence + runs
full moon at the cove + the first headstone + of falling leaves
five star hotel - + the length of your wonder + the crocus
