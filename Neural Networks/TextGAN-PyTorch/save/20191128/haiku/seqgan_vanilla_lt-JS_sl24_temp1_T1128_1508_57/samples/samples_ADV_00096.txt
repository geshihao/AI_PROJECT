the family gathered— + a gull 's bare hand , walk are + blind
stroke + time at the mountain + sad cloud + old friends

the ruins of the branch go + a cleaning view bare lights + moon

migrating geese— + she and closes the old + for a dead to lipstick

christmas wind + warmth of the old rose + old summer
summer heat + all the ways + almost tea
a soda can + moon fills the shells of + a robin day

on snow as i ~ + the sound of a tree 's birthday + with one is the mountain mist
winter day - + some the world + at burning + over the sky
driving back to meet her heat + an old woman , + then

on the pavement + in a early red love + across at the window , a house
blue sky -- - + the smell of a lights + an old gourd
autumn equinox - + the first croak + of the end of the tunnel
the family gathered— + a homeless man + passage
deep pond + thoughts in the fog + old drop
summer sky -- - + she has old + on the wall
snow in the forecast -- - + the scent of + river turtle - + the blossoms
fog lifting + the grand closed +
rainy day - + dreams of a woodpecker 's stream
doing the waste bin + a curl of platform + a smell of the back + of a snowflake
a touch + twelve moonlight + the smell of a end
steam billows + on the rainwashed past date + are
wind tonight garden + extra sugar + in the mist
eid 's + the white shower + of imported oranges
cutting snow in the fog + i talk of blue + a dragged christmas sky
twilight— + a kid man + in the sky
tea home + the moon runs + into bloom
