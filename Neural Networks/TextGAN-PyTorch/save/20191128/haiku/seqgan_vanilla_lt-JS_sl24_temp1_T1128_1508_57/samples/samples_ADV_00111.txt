harvest moon . . . + the scent of + with light time
harvest moon . . . . + old line the car + old memories
autumn wind + a hawk dances + out the wind
winter wet -- - + the old woman tries to be . + the night
clacking rails + five languages + in the garden
scattering yard of rain - + the wildflowers + to sun
winter snow + the stories air + blocked in my mirrors
sunday morning - + after the old friend + fog out
a parking louder + her wedding can . . . the house
between the roofs -- - + the grace + time to the bed
the one day -- - + i see the light + through repeat + scatter on the garden
church ruins + the silence + the sound of + to the aerials
high-stepping , + the smell of blue + old shoes
dusk + the patch of fog + the train whistle
the tall pines + the silence beyond the gate + to the old gourd
the blue pads stoops to rain - + the lipstick + on her knees
a second glass of the uncle + the scent of + she talks in + beneath
the brush + with the stone buddha - + outside
distant hurricane - + the red passes love into the + rainfall
summer heat + the boy love out + the skunk 's warning
summer heat + the magpie turns again .
the way spring in the stream + warmth of an orange + pregnant in fog
new moon . . . . + smells + of the bride tells home
sunday fog at the airport + over the river + old woman disappears + in the time
the rushing river -- + a calling of a early + old memories
the best lies + i read our tree + barely audible , the sweeper . . . dried laundry
moon in -- - + she passes me the + someone is back memories
long wind and day + ... traffic + a magpie turns and spring sky
all along a cloudburst + a pregnant mother 's + up into + old garden garden
the family gatheredâ€” + a calling of a mirror + old woman
after the tree + on the lingering day + back is shown
summer fog + the pair fades + fog horns
