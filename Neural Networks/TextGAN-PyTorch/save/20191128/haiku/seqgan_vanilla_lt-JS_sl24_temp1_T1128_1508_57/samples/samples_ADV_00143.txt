up the moon + the deep train is a silver + in running snow .
a lake + halfway at the mountain flies + the prolific blossoms - + the pumpkin ’ + falling snow
the old back + passing , the line of the last moon , half + terrorists
winter fog -- - + she has us + in the family mile
despite the snow + i just over the bed + the child 's last is shadow
a lake -- + the construction site falling -- - + over the mature corn
the slow day ... + from the old train + again
late winter fog + up the hospital + old pond at the old bed
slipping in + thoughts of the old tears + old deep footprints i
the old friend says - + i walk at the window , the sun
autumn mist + we remember the bed + the river runs .
the rail tracks - + talk of a loon 's call + to the pond
death anniversary— + a new-born calf + the river
after the tea i edge + the river 's + i already , and back + old is rose , the tracks
cinnamon oatmeal mourning + moves the fairy lights + the silence
spring moon -- + the moon in the light + in the river 's tracks
+ the cyclist + heavy time
after the fog , + a darkening path + its mother . rising
a soda can + old man 's ashes + the scent of center
the cut glass bowl + holds the branch me + in the pre-dawn dark + early
late back snow + the winter rain + the moon
the debt ceiling of earth + all day moon
old end— + two crows love out the the window , + the silence
to the attic + the hiss of the old gate + old eyes
the old barber + the fluttering in silence + over the incense
a passengers after old love + checking appear + the shadow + over top
dark blue stream + red and love + suddenly in the border clouds + old back into the old
the family gathered— + a yogi does i talk + in the cooler
typhoon -- + grey warmth the wind + is a loon
red sky- + the old + of uncelebrated birthdays
the old love - + in the grand , + old deck
falling mist + the train evening . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . deep footprints
