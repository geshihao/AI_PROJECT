summer ends- + but the way i back against + to the ceremony
winter night + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
morning coffee -- - + a candle passes ... + a little more back
winter solstice + the old woman + without me
after the rain + the morning garden pots + scratch between fog
morning fog -- - + i walk to the sunrise + time
end ... + the persistent warmth + of a loon sunshine
teenagers + umbrella . . . deep in our tears + just out the bayou
fever again + at the end + suntan lotion
winter - + the silence + of the wind
snow in the forecast -- - + the lipstick + on my neck
after my world + along the branch the railings + on the mist
abandoned farmhouse + a taste of snow + breastfeeding her kiss + on the moon
autumn snow -- - + all the blue teapot + for a very mist
winter overcast + a cow passes breast + .
a few petals + at the cracks + tanning picks eyes + the maple mother at the
black friday -- + the mosquito 's sky + red sky- ... + back and a weed
the bottle + of the door + a swan 's whiteness
winter wind + warmth of the scent + of a crack
the breeze - + a shower of love goes into
dusky clouds -- - + a fox 's + minimal
earth day ... - + reading up among find + a old calendar
summer heat + the harvest moon + on wildflower higher
the way from a kid + riding the pines + out of the air + slow and a stain
a pagoda + in the beer + dancing in her twins
sleety evening + trees i remember ...
spring sunshine + the smell of blue blue + for a blue light
little pawprints + into the grass + of the bachelorette early
a spring cloudless sunset -- - + her first hot patch + from the last time
the way summer wish + even you at the wind + a subway whistle
car park puddle -- + a milk mustache + all my bath rest , + a little more blossoms
winter - + august nude sky + without a cart up
