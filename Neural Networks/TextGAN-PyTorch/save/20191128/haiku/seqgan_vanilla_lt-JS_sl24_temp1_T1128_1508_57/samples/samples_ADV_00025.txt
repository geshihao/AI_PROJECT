morning wind - + a old memories fence + at me
restless - + a curl of incense snow + no stock brokers
a hazy moon + a snail crawls somewhere + into a names
midnight . . . + one the middle of the red + with our own beat
autumn rain + the snow on the train + on my back barn
freeze warning -- + a clarinet + until time
prayer of + beside warm winter rain + the world is upside down
overcast -- + a clarinet + until shades of sun
stone with the rose , + a greenfinch moves + lighting the valley
end ... + she to meet the tree + a checkerspot inside + without the old web
a bullock cart + loaded high with rain + the ground moon
migrating swallows + watching the first bite + of the path
june twilight - + she asks if i find + the wind
georgia peach + sweet cream windows + entrance by + with the subway
midnight + after the edge + of the campsite
a few car am ~ + a film of salt forms + vernal equinox
stars at dusk - + all those hand + in the strip mall
summer 's day -- - + all the night sky- + a magpie
autumn mist + a long fingernails drum + in the calendar + with summer day
autumn snow -- - + a dampness in the path + without a kiss
after summer fog + the birthday gift - + a house looks back
out of the fog + just watch the edge + of a clothesline
in a stronger brew + in the barbed-wire + apple
summer in + in the eyes
a love letter + in the cedars 's face out the house + dreams of the rose
snow in the forecast -- - + the smell of a blue skyâ€” + the winter sea
fresh snow + a crust of mist + at the mist
pregnant again + the smell of soft a ladder + looks up up
summer heat + all the end + we have falling full a train
night night - + a calling of wild geese + arrows south
lakeside + a dry leaf + in the darkness
snow covered temple + ... + becomes a lipstick + hibiscus in + to a passing flower
