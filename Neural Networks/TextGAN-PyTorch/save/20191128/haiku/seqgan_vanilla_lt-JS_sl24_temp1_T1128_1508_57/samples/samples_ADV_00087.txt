the dragonfly forest falling + on my back light
midwinter dusk - + oak branches fracture + call to be . . + spring mist
the blizzard ... + a broken scrubs - + snow 's thoughts
a soda can + drifts out + she in me + thoughts
unknotting + the columbine still + leans on snow
the moon - + all the ways + new moon
autumn stream + a cloud passes + scatter with the moon
deep the wind + a beach love lost + at me
winter day - + under a friend , + white walk interrupted
butterfly on the river -- - + i just before your tea cup + old mattress
mayflowers + only the back + high â€™ s lights
winter beach - + back in the restaurant + addressing christmas shadow
the budapest square -- + a japanese neighbor left + in the sky
the morning fog - + with the dead leaf + slow falling
eid moon + the rose crows + on the red
giant deep morning - + blossoming in the fog + back to reveal river + at the mist
a street artist + soon a garden buddha + the snail is us + autumn drought
summer heat + the tentative line + etched open the + rose
almost sky + the moon dances + in the back
the crunch + fallen leaf + pear blossoms
morning fog -- - + a deep croak + of a dripping glides + across my bath
snow and melting , + the new garden + for a tanning salon
winter sea + and sweet night -- + a daisy-chain
the road glare + with old back + out of the cold + early
a soda can + drifts out + she smiles
after the rain + the lipstick + on today 's colour
when knot + in before i walk + on the mist
a final date -- + mingling their ashes + ... the deep back to heat
goodwill window sound + crows might closes + and out the tunnel
indian summer + ant on the train + at the text , + summer heat
sunny day of the moon + the way i left ' + summer moon
winter day - + thoughts of snow + in the valley
