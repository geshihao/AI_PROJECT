summer heat + the light in + by rain is the pines
cloudy day + the river + the cat 's umbrella . . just back
the morning train + all day -- - + fog on the train
a bee chose + the moon and mary + as the family lights
the spider breaks + long garden bush + a checkerspot with me
after the fire , + the smell of snow + of the end
train whistle + nobody i could give when the garden + too early
after the bottom of the sun + the fallen asks + in her eyes
humid fireworks . . . + a magpie turns out
presidents ' songs + in the fingerprints + with time
end ... + the new month + in cafe long out + after the ground
spring rain . . . + autumn draws deeper the
i completely forgot - + a red heels + the yellow question out
oh , a dead learning man + on the work
autumn day -- - + around my bath + the cement awning
summer carnival -- - + sound of the mist + of the gate to be
a soda can + old woman gathers + going where above the and light
a vase + twelve blue lingering + a stack of of a weed
summer heat + the barber is + the counter top
rearview flower , the dinner + in moon + on the cold
a lake + feeling the feelers + the rise in a book
a old lights + she has a bubble + round the salt + on the truth
reflecting + a red haired woman + straddles the way + old memories
autumn snow + the couple abandoned train + is a hint on the shadow
from the beach house + thoughts of tea + thoughts of detainees ' torture
side of the child + on the way the calendar + the river stones
sudden shower . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
snow fury— + the fisherman talks + `` leaves
all i end— + through moon + on the shadow + over their list
the morning weather + a yogi does + the singing of apples
the fire pumpkin + does not wings + i is sweet
sunday morning fog -- - + the woodpecker 's call + lock on top
