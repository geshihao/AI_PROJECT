campfire + at the way the path + thoughts of coffee beating
beer bottles + clink and a lawn + empty sound
between + fog to the woods + a dragged essence
deep to snow + the slow drip , in the clouds , + snow
alabaster moon + on the ring of the oscars- + in the sand
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + a bright way + left for a candle
back over the roofs -- - + a woman 's umbrella + + in my tea
sound of heavy rain + i write + the smell of a cross
half moon -- - + your day after + unreachable
all i town - + the graffiti looks + dirtier
dusty seashell + the parents of the moon + on a shot-out sign
back on the taste + of the river + on a dripping tap + winter twilight
i pass the binoculars + dreams of a snow fills + river flows on
winter + summer light + in a raptor + spring warm another
partly cloudyâ€” + i watch the blue patter + migrating snow
arguing downstairs -- - + i finally washed + deep back and a towel
border window + the truck seasonal cookies + eaten blood on the tunnel
a soda can + + a homeless dollhouse + in me
back on the raw wood + she is woman with war + on the oldies station
blackbird song - + the morning 's son + scorching summer
back home -- - + she has + the way out to the + clouds for a towel
stormy weather -- + a mantle of snow + on the page
coolness up the moon - + she is flies goes + on the lawn
a few renovation -- + all the time + she looks at me + in the mist
winter rain -- + a line of the goldenrod + thoughts on bloom
winter clouds + at the end + the patter of moon + on the tunnel
evening much a spot + i see her tea + for the wind
a little more tar + of moths shadow
equinox - + two heart on the + back lock on my emptiness
summer heat + i walk up + a wifi hotspot
mountain road + the lengthening pauses + on the grand sky + autumn moon
summer heat + shades of snow + smiles suddenly
