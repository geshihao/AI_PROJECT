last station forget + i almost on the scent + of the light the air
chasing bubbles + thoughts + the silence of an orange river
the earth day + the scars + umbrella lanterns + over the mirror + the road
snow in the cold fog + snow 's + palm is the window , + in the pre-dawn dark
the news + far away in me + over the cool time
a moth flies + a snail 's legs + changes
autumn first day -- - . . + the old air + on old direction
equinox - + the lingering warmth + the child is may moon
the old town -- + the warming moths + in the lake 's window
failing light . . . + all the snow can . + a new-born truck window
the police stream â€™ s + lingering scent + before i may snow
the passing garden + house to me + in the shadow to + back lock of my skin
the wind of over + the day moon + over the last moon is hover + time
airport fog -- - + the smell of the summer 's feet + early
cool breeze - + the only in the window + the whole world is over the wood
frost falling fog + the morning train is + in the window
autumn mist ... + the barber pisses + in the family
summer longing + a yogi pisses + all the family me + in the family sky
the old rose + only the world in the + only is the free bus
the recession -- - + a police kisses me + from a passing cloud
the one day -- - + my neighbor in the + with an old doghouse
foreclosure 's + fluttering in the thick + over the tunnel
edge of the road open the + moon here alone ...
morning fog -- - + i awakened her love are + autumn moon
a sudden call light + the newborn colt + in the earth + over the chair rose
the old breeze - + the old woman looks love + is shadow is shadow
a side of the twelve-carriage platform + into last night
how the day of the call + the way i put a loon shatters + the sky
fog over the river ... + the last path + to the light of
winter day day -- - + your day so + half the lie
deux cygnes + planting wind
the day hides , + the smell of a cane + i is a old deck bed
