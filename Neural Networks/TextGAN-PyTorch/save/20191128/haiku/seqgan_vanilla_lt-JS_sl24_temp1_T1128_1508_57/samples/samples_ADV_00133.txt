moon clouds - + the old tombstone + keeps the sky
the spider 's day + the scars + umbrella sky . . . . deep deep side
desert wind -- + a echo of fried + so many birds : + ... , sea
letting the branch meet + the fluttering of sky -- - + the streetlight
autumn chill - + the blue moon + suddenly the thoughts
old pond + until the silence beyond the red tide + over gaza
train whistle— + clouds comes + in the river runs .
a lake + feeling the twinkle cry + in the masks + in the ice
in the river bank breath . . . + the old grandchild + late time
thousands of the child drowned , the book + a white man 's reflection + the silence of snowflakes
a short highway hearts on + over the edge of the + half moon + old memories
summer heat -- - + your day fog , red stop + rose , the moon
a parents of fog + the lingering man + serves me out the shadow
summer snow + in the tea outside + the crescent moon
a church comes at the meadow , the me someone + in the cooler + old pond .
snow melt -- + the last time + in the stone bonfire
just back in the roofs -- - + dirt is i take i back track out + over the land
the old mother . . . . + the homeless man gathers cans + break the shadow
harvest moon ... + the only fish , + the old man gathers + for five tastes the tracks
hospice window + the sound of a book , + two conversations
zazen - + a kid asks if + the child 's car ’ s shadow
new fire + for a windharp + the moon
the blank page + learning to the ant climbs + the twelve-carriage keys + over the heat
the blues singer + sitting chasing wind
the reeds + of grey night + are unfair
rainy after the river -- + a little lost + a midge
scent of snow + the moon + a skunk 's window
a railroad window + a magpie turns may a book +
a lake + feeling the mardi meet + hot force + frost is the family garden
the suite s door + blue corn has + on the plane reaches in the a book : + over the moon
avalanche warning- + she tells the stop + thoughts of day
the blank page + learning to the mirror + the silence reaches the blossom snow + are and a end
