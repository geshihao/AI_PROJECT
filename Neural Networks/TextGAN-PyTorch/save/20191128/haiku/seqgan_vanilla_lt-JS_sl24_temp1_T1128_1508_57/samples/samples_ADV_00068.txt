after winter sesshin + sharing day + back to a cross
after the moon + a snail crawls meet along + almost falling + a snail 's eyes
in the moon + the bottle only + cover with stars ... + open
at the funeral i birthday + does not has us - + the auctioneer
delta blues ... + snow and a last bark + is a tussock
december heat - + a man and closes + thoughts
standing stock-still : + the sweet home + and then + a carpenter wall
morning fog -- - + snowflakes settle + over the icebergs
winter -- + a cool hats a hot cup + time
autumn woods - + the friend in the moon + a daisy-chain
summer heat + the crinkled edges + between bad in me + old is koi
on snow empty clouds + the last whistle + on the epitaph- + + red touch grey
way back of + the rain of summer rain + the pond in
winter - + some stars and + one is snow
whistling clouds + and i it all went book + on the moon
breast + drifts out + the same yard light
morning fog -- - + our kitchen windows fog ... + thoughts
cold rainy day -- - + a few seeds + of a thatch
morning troubles + split the old desoto + ...
road closed + does n't care + a faucet dripping
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + summer 's back
end ... + the moon + on the pine
empty square - + a snoring punctuated + to work , + a calm mist
winter night + the barber from red we nails + left a neon
shoots of + long and warm + summer blue snow , red
veteran 's day + cool silence + on my backdoor
mid-winter thaw -- + bird i head out + over the moon
the silence + i leave the dog + red angle passing
computer crash ... + she 's boyfriend 's eyes - + the dialysis center
a path shorter now + i after the grey snow + thoughts and snow
filtering in november + thoughts from the recent dawn + steaming birds
apples cooking : + at the family , + the ac gets cooler
