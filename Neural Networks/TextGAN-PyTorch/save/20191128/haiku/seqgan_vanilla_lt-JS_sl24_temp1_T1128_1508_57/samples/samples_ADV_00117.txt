+ the cyclist + is this time
dry stream bed + old oak shadow + old memories
the cool maple + bay . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
hot silence + the moon + in their owners chat
my son 's birthday -- + so time + she looks at me + in the river
anzio beach wind - + stars together + in the pond
rainy sky -- - + she 's bottle , + a faucet steam
snow and short here and i + she takes off the marketplace + over the old man
summer heat + the couple + haiku ever + out of mist
a lake + feeling the taste + in the red moon
indian summer + two to meâ€” + a calling of a loon 's call + to the mosquito
windy day -- - + the train runs ahead
summer heat + the little salt + in the old gourd
empty square cadence + empty grass + talk + in the ceremony
the age + the silence + of the compartment
the snow turns to come and go - + the old lilac out to feet + the silence
in the fog -- - + as the counter + two moon at the tracks
circle against + gentians blooming -- + over the incense stick out + a dragged christmas sky - + over the wind
in this day + she 's warmth + n't basket
summer heat + reaches in the hands
first day of the moon + the smell of a kid + in minnesota
summer storm . . . + my barber appears + in to rest , the bed + butterfly
snow and short roses + blooming snow + in the river runs
train whistle + someone on the last patch + far apart
five star hotel - + fluttering in the rest , + old rainy day
the one i close -- + a desk + time she wears a closed + nudists club
all the mardi gras colors + ... of the face of the green house + heat
- after heavy fog + she to meet the moon + on the fog
screen of bare coffee , the last page + with snow
falling fog + with the tongue with mist + the subway
valentine 's day + the barber , the missing can shadow + old garden
half moon - + the cherry blossom is + the moonlit door
