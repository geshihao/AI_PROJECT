driving home + the world behind— + fishing
garden buddha + a magpie + monochrome
missing for sale , + a reek of revelations + rising of grey
next to midnight + a street garden mirror + fog
blood-tinted soil + each cock + stares at me
moon at the beach- + the cherry blossom garden + thoughts on the rose
police sirens -- - + i a dead leaves
summer evening - + all the ways + suntan lotion
autumn equinox - + a lamp i beer + from cedar else
zen garden + i phonecall + of homeless hair
headlights + in the river + new moon
autumn equinox - + a hot breeze iridesce + a blue harness -- .
a train whistle + someone has love me + and the bottom of the tunnel
obituary + a child 's hand on closed + my thoughts
driving to meet + the season pregnant cool + + all day
first light + the moon + on the lawn
summer longing + a early moon moves + on the rose
summer longing + a red haired whole boy and i + only pounding day
in the same old . . . . + even i put a faucet dripping
summer heat + a strands of smoker moves from a missing + into moon
harvest moon ... + the blue lights gathers + for a haiku
passing cloud— + only one + in the eye + last time
after the rain + a taste of the bed + a balloon + moonrise
summer longing + the lingering scent + of two well ~ + moonless dawn
at a door -- - + the sound of + snow tan
wildfire -- - + the smell of light + of the snow
rearview : + just enough + along the rain
in silence + the silence of me to sea + to the mist
rainy day + she has a tractor + thoughts of the gate + into the rainbow
equinox - + the night runs + autumn moon
empty house + a bluebird 's call + to sky
summer sky -- - + another dreams + fog on the lawn + a with silver maples
