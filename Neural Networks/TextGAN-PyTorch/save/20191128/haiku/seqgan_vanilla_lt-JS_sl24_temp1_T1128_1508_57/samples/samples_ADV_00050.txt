morning cold + a strands of rooster ant still love locks + at me
winter sun + a cockroach spins + for vespers
a hundred streets named + peachtree a undercurrent somewhere
deep at the ground + the mist has + the milky way
white white hair + reading a raindrop + drifts
hell -- - + she 's warmth + empty is + in my alley
traffic snow + spring moon - + in the fog
haiku group + drifts with + with the garbage shadow + + i good light
brush still fog + the train tracks + and splits again
industrial decay -- - + a little sky
a soda can + shot full of holes -- + i wake + autumn moon
no sunshine -- - + a student drawing + shells in the moon
globe lilies + a clarinet of sky + day moon
winter - + a air conditioner â€™ hand ... + is shutters
winter solstice + the quarter + in moon + in the hand ...
scudding clouds + a little shorter + for a empty heat
the moon - + with light has washes + a daisy-chain
a long list curled + bends of darkness + and lavender items
winter greys -- + found a parking sake i snow + crackles in the tunnel
ash wednesday - + i check the city incense + old pond
winter wind + warmth of the way + in moonlight
grey day + the autumn draws early window + the silence
winter - + summer in the leaf + spring rain
autumn snow + the little salt + in a far-away land
coolness in a single + of bluegrass ... + spring day
morning fog -- - + a golden dot on her hand ... + thoughts
a long list + cursing the river + empty garden
summer heat + a cherry blossom snow + plum turns to s dream .
morning fog -- - + i head out + on the barbed bags
first snow + the old life laid jar , half dusk cloud
in the sound + of the window screen + heat
summer heat + a long pause + smiles forgetting
