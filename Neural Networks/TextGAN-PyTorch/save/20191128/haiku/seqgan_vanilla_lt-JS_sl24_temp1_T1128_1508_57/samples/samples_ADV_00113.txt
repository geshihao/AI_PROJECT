edge the pond - + the palm prints + linger
the old beach stop + i walk back into the + running in me
summer 's day , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i put in the curtains
a lake + feeling the taste + drip , this time
winter solstice + the scars + of crows hover + just out
good friday -- - + one last blossoms + the moon
clouds gather + the fog rolling + . . . all day
june hides school + the blackbird alone i . . . + the child 's shadow
on the pavement + in the tongue of a blue sky— + the church
a steam the bucket + by river 's + the train
back over the river + the child 's hand , the platform + on old brick wall
november sea + the scent of + snail 's hand
final -- + the truck dirtier tanning was half + almost way back
spring fog -- - + the way in the wind
i umbrella day + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the rail tracks + the real iris bluer + than the gate
the only the door -- - + the sun moves the iraq + over + time
starless night -- - + i over the sand , + autumn moon
october autumn snow + the barber and dates + over the rest
after the river + the chill of rain + on the old gourd
winter rain- - + long beer + turns in the last + over china
over the day + on the way back heavy snow + old light out
morning haze - + the cherry men . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the clatter + of scar tissue— + rising of
a few notes + out the shells of his laptop + time to the rose
summer heat + the woman too short sky + same clouds
first firefly . . . . + a cough spot . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
morning fog -- - + the sound of moths + on the shadow
the silence + i i am loses falling ...
night love at the day + with many darkening back , + the last blossoms
the recession -- - + the old man 's + only its life - + over the incense shadow
the family gathered— + a oak tree + the fresh snow on the heat
