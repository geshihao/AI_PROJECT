summer 's day , . . i + floating fog + the last blossoms
a lake + feeling the shopkeeper + chalk meet date + is the last hour drift + over the snow
snow and do snow + the last blossoms + old rainy day
the dance of fog , the mirror + a clear warmth + falling in + heavy a saxophone
the wind of old + in the family me + in the cooler , + last blossoms
fog over the river + the persistent warmth + a new-born slate
on the side to meet + rain in the window ... + over the mist + last sky
endless blue sky + i become visible + over the mist + over the heat 's fountain
independence light . . . i could give the moon , the streetlight -- - + the brick wall
fog over the pond . . . + never time . . . day the
fog over the river ... + the child runs + in the wood
a second glass of mists ... + the old man + half moon
summer fog -- - + i leave the empty house
summer fog -- - + i find the blue skyâ€” + the taste moon
first day of the moon , the moon , the potter + at dawn . . . all day
a flickering wait + in one step + she looks at me + over the moon
a lake + flings its way + the silence + the shape of the moon + and spring
falling fog -- - + the last world is the window red
in the river -- - + the lingering beach train + to red -- -
steam again + the last blossoms + a early break + over the last shadow
as i the rain + the haiku poet 's coat ... + fog
winter day day -- - + she looks out the taste + in the river 's shadow a heat
autumn snow -- - + i nothing i left i love + here runs
summer heat + the magpie turns everything
among the moon -- - + the last world is the window + a calm waiting
summer rain + the barber can + the curve of the + over the table
equinox - + a train runs ... + ... , the last sky . light
failing light . . . + she 's warmth + his guitar + to the mountain first day
the blank page + she 's closes the full + with dog
in the fog -- - + i do the streetlights lipstick + the sweet running rose
autumn light -- - + i thoughts on the day + a rainbow in the last sky . day
the smell + forgotten a few notes sign , + the salt air
