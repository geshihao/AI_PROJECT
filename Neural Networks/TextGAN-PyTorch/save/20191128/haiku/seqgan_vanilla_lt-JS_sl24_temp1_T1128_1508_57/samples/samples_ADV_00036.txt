silence - + a magpie 's hover + turns into snow
first snow -- + the spider 's navigation
almost tea + at the edge of a tree + more enough long chemo
half her day - + starts down + of bad tea
summer in + the silence + in a end of summer
a butterfly + words + a name of december + rain on the + old cricket ...
the young deer + in the heartland grey dreams + and i cane . . . . . . . . . . .
the black woman + of a grey man + the sparks
a soda can + shot full + of a blue plate
wooden buddha + tea graffiti + on the pond
day moon - + a harvest pauses + puddles of + lighting bugs
red lobster- + not out the garden bush + on the family book
june swings from grey melting + the spent rain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
a winter moon - + the warmth of the loon shatters + the bridge
the old teapot , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
summer sidewalk - + a three-legged chair + and 'sold '
a pile of winter + snow and blue pot + silence
summer heat + a couple of red house + a faucet dripping
thai restaurant -- - + i finally are cooking the love + on its hand
church graveyard + a echo of crows + children play together
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
soft garden + she buys + the cherry blossom
distant thunder + frogs and blackbirds + in a cigarette
a storm star + the truck fingerprints + loses darker
the old dreams + first of my daughter + spilling with sky
winter morningâ€” + a winter moon + is dollhouse
summer mountain 's tree + on the morning mist + smiles at me
a rainy morning + bedraggled no beach field + to the mist
a soda can + shot woman he browse + through the porch + looks a touch + field
no moon ... + the sweet warmth + and all those tea
even her voice + a magpie runs . . deep
autumn bonfire . . . . . . and fish + let the railroad house ... + . . . . . . .
