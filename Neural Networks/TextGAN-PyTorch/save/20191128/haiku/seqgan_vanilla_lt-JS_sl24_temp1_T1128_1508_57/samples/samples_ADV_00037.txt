the wind of winter + ... so snow + all walk the
windy mist + the smell of blue red + starts with time
morning fog -- - + our tears flesh + spring graffiti -- - + summer fog
failing light . . . . + this scent of the wind + too
rushing moon + a cut tunnel
among the dishes - + a dampness in the floor migrates + to a foggy old + childhood
dusk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
rain settles + through crows is + the free world
deep to heat + a birthday 's + bag while
fish bone + thoughts + in a harvest moon
traffic at night - + the train whistle + not worth keeping
perseid showers + across the sidewalk + only the shower
summer heat + the wave gathers + and splits + the pond ice
a soda can + sand in the begging monk + and 'sold '
a cool train -- + at me comes over the + mirror else— ?
morning haze -- - + the old cat + only in the moon
winter rain- + thoughts and stars + and splits again
a dull ache + the memory of snow + of a garden
winter morning— + the apple tree + a little shorter
the clattering + of the mourning dove + + by 20 summers
summer 's end + the tenderness + of moon
serving coffee + a blue sky . . + back to a tussock
a bugler plays the work - + a name of her bed - + a magpie runs : + to the park
burning leaves -- - + a mixture of the oscars- + in moon
sculpting + nest back down + the calm bay
cloudy morning . . . + a diamond 's eyes + the rose
those river + the name of the window + a midge
summer wind + warmth of the alamo + turning to other hand
all my son - + all my words + still at the + summer
seniors dance + the real iris bluer + near the sprinkler
summer fog end ... + the magpie + monochrome
news to -- + the last night runs + warmth her wait in sale
