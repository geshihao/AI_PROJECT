quiet fog -- - + the moon breaks the + hard in snow
a touch + with the child - + with ridges of iowa bags + for five dollars
falling fog -- - + i nothing in the + old memories
autumn snow -- - + i leave the tea i love are + old friends
watching cold snap -- + the sound of some one + back as i meant to i as i + white plum blossoms
harvest moon -- + the last time + the last whistle a end ...
on the pavement + you and old + long before + thoughts to the heat 's last
a clear side of heavy fog , + an amish foot + the last blossoms
first day of the snow + the doctor touches of last + with a passing cloud
break up + the river bank + in the last sky and light
unconcerned + of rain ... + snow 's autumn
midwinter dusk - + how two love story + beneath the fog + old memories
the clattering air + scent of heavy time . . . . day
autumn equinox - + the last blossoms + after the window , red fog
summer clouds + without the river bank + only the last sky .
new moon -- + i i still dangle is me + back and one
i long june day -- - + the whistle of stars , + the last watermelon tastes the sound
new moon -- + a mantle of snow + in the window , the family garden
deep old mountains , + all the deep red sky- + the old eyes : + thoughts
the clattering + of lake -- - + the moon
snow over i wake + a taste of fog + and all the sand , + summer rain
stuck in the moon , i find + i i share the last page
winter day day -- - + i over the train moon + over the sky + old back
a dull ache + i the desk , + i walk out
morning fog -- - + i find the last blossoms + to a tea
alphabet soup - + the computer stirs + the wheel 's headlights
cooking -- + . . . i aspen rains too + even is the sky + storm is the brewery
first day of day -- - + the child runs . . . + i put the river of the bed
way back back , + the back rose + old shoes
the recession -- - + she looks at me + in the corner store
a glasses stare + the beetle and mary + waiting for the loon shatters
a lake + feeling the desk cart + a three-legged chair + over the moon
