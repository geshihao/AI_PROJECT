the stare + of a cracked house + over the table
lily pond at snow + the barber is a raindrop + alzheimer 's day
summer heat + the scars + umbrella blossoms
everything + the blue sky + a midge
falling snow + the forecast ring + in the zen garden
autumn snow -- - + she passes me the forecast + all dawn 's day
summer heat + the crinkled edges + between blooms
first day + the lake of + to tropical snow
summer fog -- - + the asphalt train + to the sky
side of the pavement + i take i used to be . . . + old egg better
the stream couple + a little hand 's talons + snow
the last stories + a new barber is + with rainbows
winter fog -- - + all the sand scent + of the phone
frozen home - + the train runs + over the wall
summer heat + the crack in the wind screen + over the heat wave
a butterfly , + the old man passes me + in the cooler
rainy sky -- - + a woman 's umbrella + a crocus
winter day day -- - . . . + watching the cat turns out + as gone as call at + as before
back over the old woman + a boat on the fog + the fedex man
humid morning . . . + a yellowed love + gasping for me
winter day -- - + not the moon + on time
mother â€™ s day + the woman , so shorter + moves the garden
winter clouds -- - + at the last open me + with the summer
on the office night -- - she comes + at the last light of the old gourd
winter wind -- - + scent of the stone leaves + over the moon
summer heat + the magpie turns a house , red passing
first light + the bar tender ran out of the sky . + summer day a wall
a walking sunday mountain + go at the window + the silence
after the day - + the smell of old + of the bed
good friday -- - + the quiet old tears + at the wind
first crowing + schoolgirls sniffing body conditioner drips + again
my mother cries + on the way she finds + the rose
