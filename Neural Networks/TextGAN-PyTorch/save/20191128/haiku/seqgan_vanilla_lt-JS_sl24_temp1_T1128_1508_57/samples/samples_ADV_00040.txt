all day + by the sidewalk : + she runs ...
sunday wind at + running with a red leaf + is the lingering day
she 's found the gate + and a garden is + early morning coffee
snow comes in + summer holds the sweet scent + with a satellite dish
first frost - + the gentle rise and mountain notch + in the air
the shower of rain + in the exercise yard— + convicts shoot the breeze
autumn evening - + i even the plane + mother 's thoughts
pinned butterfly ... + ... horses hauds up right into red -- - + the calm
crescent moon -- - + i the yellow mirror
a gloomy sunday . . . + first snow , no green + for a neon site
end of the moon - + long before the + reflects a loon deepens
a long line of ants of the match + a kid comes in + in the river
a dry walk + but there , + all the wind
lingering day - + a checkerspot in our address + + on fog
a soda can + hangs and stop + and snow
morning sun + the construction breaks early
passing cloud— + she tells a sleeve— tonight 's + into snow
letting the branch go + a tiny foggy grey sky + a smoke wisp
i end— + tea and + can in the compartment + home
summer lilac + on the fireworks + a witch passes me + over the rice
rainstorm + night -- + a company graffiti
snow crocus + the old garden + about more direction
on lake - + of a snail 's eyes -- - + still unclimbed
the moon - + with a fish only + playing the intersection
early spring . . . . + just enough i take love + and a bleating lamb
evening fog -- - + the navel poppies + on glass
storm -- - + the old lilac in + silence
winter morning + finding + of seventy-eights
winter solstice + ... horses browse + through a raindrop bloom
leap year - + with another call + into the moon
winter - + back talk into the + in the sky
autumn -- - + end of the scent + of spring day
