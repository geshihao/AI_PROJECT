full moon - + with brittle blue mist + in the garden
faltering light + we know + by the silence
falling dark + a retirement card +
walking to the requiem + beads of day + snow
still at dusk + my wedding pictures + on fliers ,
watching winter moon + a half full + of yellow mosquito
upstairs , swathed + in front of the table + fog suddenly
snow covered temple + ... horses browse + through her lipstick
winter rain + a breeze carries in + as the pre-dawn too
friday french fields + until a length of an eyes + my diamond
an way only + down the rainy day + he question laps
gaza in through : + ... + climbing so cold . . . + her sing louder
bulbul blues + the oil post red flower + old names in the bedroom
everything + far from the calendar
faltering light + we collected for her— + you makes the bed
struggling from + the soft rose breath
black walk to work - + she 's half + their absence
moving in the moon + her umbrella freezes + the road thick road + house
winter evening + finding my pocket— + candle
gloomy afternoon -- - + the sun appears + in her chin
porch swing + how many nude statues + in the gin bottles
tying a knot + in the window + a man 's doghouse
sleepless night - + the silence + through tears
a gloomy sunday + the morning paper + wondering there
ghost town -- + flock of my house + and a full moon
at nightfall + a sweetness + in a much louder
summer 's day + my mother 's voice + where the bedroom of cicadas
the bugler plays fall in french , + an pony takes sweet through their breath + i 'll there
cold mist + a carpenter ant wanders + louder
rain settles + each year of a traveling + haiku
the soldier 's son + still going in the road + in its emptiness
after heavy rain + my back grow at bridge + from the old elm
