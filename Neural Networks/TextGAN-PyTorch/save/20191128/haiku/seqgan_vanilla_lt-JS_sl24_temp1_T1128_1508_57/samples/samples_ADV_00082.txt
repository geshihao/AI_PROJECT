will we feel + in black knights
after the cloudburst + a kid has + a skunk 's warning
valentine 's day -- - + a little wet love + a dragged new moon
morning cloudy sky -- - + not a fish , + icicle all
after the roofs -- + the scent of something + of the call for sale
wood flute music - + a red haired woman + smiles at the warmth
at the rose + a white christmas rain + a faucet dripping
the name + on the last step a breeze + moves the bedroom
summer coffee + spilling with ports + the smell of a fish + old brick wall
morning fog -- - + a goose honks me + the prison spring sky
winter breeze + sunlight of + scent of the tunnel
cloud drifts + the moon + on a green in lost
summer heat + a silence of the forest + a little higher
after the burial ... + the water inside the + cool silence . shadow
midnightâ€” + the year 's hand + occupies to his mouth + fog
summer heat + a line of the atlas his eyes ... + + by a towel
summer sea . . i never back + flies to me
summer 's end + i tea into hand ... + back home
old love letter + the breeze carries in the + grey sky
december rain - + a blue sky + for a old plant-pot .
back at the tracks ... - + the moon is on her breath + a snail 's + break in sale
morning fog -- - + the convict 's arms
december warm the wind + this mountain ridge + a rose
she looks up + the curtains , the gate + in the rose
a street artist + soon grey over + the wind pushes the cheek + autumn moon
words + to the world the way + with the funeral
winter evening + a few blocks closer + than his drinking sky
harvest moon . . . . . . and i talk + in the park
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + i remains centered
autumn equinox + the whistle of the edge + of the snow 's old quarter
rainy dawn -- + she me only the railings 's window + the train driver + + on the oldies station
rivulets + on the beach geese + back into the wood
