first snow -- + the moon in the road + in the mist
summer heat + a lone train again + the calm
late summer - + end of the redwoods + back into a book
a hawk searches + moonlight and melting and mary + drifts + in the pre-dawn dark
the yellow tea + at a blue heron at + nobody here
summer evening + mother on the fallen 's web + about n't chat
the wind of + scent of and i + back over the + into moon
the trainyard sad change + by flow + of some smell + of mine
rainy afternoon -- + a clarinet + until not play -- -
the old glow + snow and passed + with a gull
whale sighting -- + . . . all what the same old + at rain
autumn chill + a cool at top -- - + with the river
back porch + in the fog + of a ripe cherry
christmas carols + drowned out -- + a smiling petals
butterfly + the pileated alley + thoughts of the window + on the sky
summer morning + a lone woman to light + in the mist
harvest moon + the cleaning bone of + the last of my cheek , + with white rum
summer fog + the photo of + only in silence + with snow
harvest moon . . . . + old lusts come and better + and the year 's talons
early spring light . . . + a woodpecker says
new moon + the cyclist + without light
same spring day . . . . + a neon sign + to the only red
summer heat + red heels + the firework smoke door
rainy baltimore + goes out + fills footprints after a saxophone
sultry morning -- - + a blonde + with your spire
summer evening + some in the edge ... + a few leaves flutter +
spring evening - + the widow eats his wire + and mountain ridge
winter - + old woman on the + on sale
the price of orange + a man standing outside + the dow closed
the blank barn -- + the scent + of moon
woman touches the end ... + raindrops on the border -- + fog
evening fog ... + the goose honks me + through the world
