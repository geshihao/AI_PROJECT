a rainy morning + water i remember + the pregnant light is the hand ... , + the blue sky
fourth winter wind -- - + guests beer + + the last lingering
a passing stream + + the scent of + snow tan
summer heat + the photo of heavy highway + the river of old home
in the river -- - + the small of snow + old brick chimneys
august wind + the line of the back + smell of tea
away from and stars , + heavy blue jar , + says the rose
obsidian day -- - + i and i take through the sky 's mist
i hug the cobweb ... + a drop of snow + time
after the moon + she 's whole hour + in a loon 's call + over the heat
summer 's day , . . . , a maw snuves + soak up fourth
morning day -- - + i find the wind , red much + even to the wind

autumn day -- - + i leave the last blossoms + near the rain
scooping steamed red + i walk appear + the last sky

a lake + feeling the blank page + its bare foot talking + back and a weed
