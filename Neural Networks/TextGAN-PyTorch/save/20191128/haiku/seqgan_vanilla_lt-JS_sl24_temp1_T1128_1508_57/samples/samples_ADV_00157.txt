snow in the darkening back + quickens in the branch as ... + all the way i good done i rises
a king road -- + just the cherry blossoms + spring mist
the light of fog + a cricket 's whole + neighbor is a graffiti + goes fishing
between the sky + as iraq + over the green 's red + is dead to me
after the red train + in the corner waits i . . . . . can + i read the wind
dead end— + a red high at + by time
after the cloudburst + outside the moon + a midge
buenos aires tango + her husband starts early + at the old north
train running thoughts + the train is a kid + of falling over the + dreams
a lake + feeling the midnight . . . + a sitting breaks + over the moon
autumn day -- - + she looks falling + thoughts the neighbor 's last bottle
a soda can + phone number , and braille + the river 's path
the grey night + at the last blossoms + old tea bag
long rainy day -- - + the last time + the sun reaches the red + in hand is sunset
a lake + feeling the mardi meet + only in the edge + a train in + terrorists
our address -- - + i another man gathers + watching the heavy cheek -- - + darker
washday gossip— grey + homeless man 's cracked house + is passed day --
summer heat - + back , the wind gathers + + the cold poppy
cold fog -- - + the sound of + as those blue sky— + the moon
the sound of geese + from the old bed + early in grey
rain in the fog , + the rose , lost again are as love + the silence
the way in the pollution -- - + as another shadow + over the old company
clear day -- - + the cold moon
summer heat + the photo of heavy family , + in the chill
the old line + in the walls of fried walk alone + the river of the rose
sunday fog break - + the last blossoms + wild orchids the heat 's mist
old love letter . . + christmas barber , red foliage + spring mist
the rain of the moon , no + their pause + of seventy-eights
after the cloudburst + in the tea does + along the gate red
in the river -- - + the bright shadow to + dreams .
falling fog + tea over the morning + again
mirror- the wonder gathers + a homeless man gathers cans + break moon
