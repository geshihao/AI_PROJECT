winter drags . . . . + in the marketplace + gasping for water
high tide + i shadow , air + horse 's backside
beer bottles + clink in the height marks + + on the couch
desert wind -- + wind blows - + thoughts of the tunnel
snow in the end ... + the sharpness in her dreams + of the river
the empty nest + soft rain on the ring + in a collar
a butterfly , + the way to meet + the line of old elm
rainy dawn and wind + the ring of the skyline + my father 's mist
end ... + the moon in the wood + by mist
the lawn site 's thoughts + without me + speaks in the sky . deep
a soda can + and warm free hair + even out the life + almost touch
a girl at the soul + of the scent + of garlic looks up
winter greys -- + found the book -- + a wave in falling + a crocus
a love letter + mum holds men + in the goldenrod
windswept silence - + an last time are back + over the last thoughts
i arrange my tie + to wash the dishes
the moon - + with sound of too + with a first time ... + a helmut of sky
a white pregnant with stars + the snail 's wife + sharp bark + till again
autumn sky + the couple of tea pot + for lingering feet
a second glass of here . . . + a harvest moon + on my bath towel
a long wooden april rain - + the coffeecup harvest moon + is a half moon
summer fog + the blackbird in common ... + nobody
dusk ... + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
summer heat + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
oh , a bluebird 's book . . . . + a half moon
biting for a moor + with watch the moon
in the moon + the silence between us + winter solstice
croton hedges + with their wings has lost ... + old deck chair
falling leaves- + unpacking a moth â€™ s + minimal
way back of + by the old friend passes me + the moon
false spring day -- - + the sound of a fish + of the mist
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + a long chemo cap tracks ...
