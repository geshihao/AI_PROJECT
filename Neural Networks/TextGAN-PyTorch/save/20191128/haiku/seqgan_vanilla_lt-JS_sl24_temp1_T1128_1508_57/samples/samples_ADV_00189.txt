a dry beach irene + in the last step the snow appears + old back
moon in the raw at window + the cat turns and a light + share the red hair
rainy sky -- - + i conversation falling snow
a photo + from the dry fields grey wake + blue direction
the moon - + forgotten and the family me + thoughts on the heat 's mist
lanternless of summer -- - + the scent of + river too old night + over + snow 's
traffic light . . . . + a faint scent of eyes fog
maple in hand , + the only you left + back to the sky
after the autumn leaves -- - + i touch the window , + to a aerials
autumn fog -- - + i long last + back smiles over the bayou
a teacup -- - + the way i were + early day
winter day day -- - . . + i thoughts on the roofs , + in the old beach
the old hair + in the doorways + in the rainbow
winter rain -- + the river bank + each love out the + to the window , the window
spring mist obscures the + moon in the homeless + in the warmth + over the moon
a railroad window + a long back + thoughts of the last white wake
lingering day -- - + i love back ' + more time . day the moon
i long day -- - + the end of the lights + half moon of
the old tea + learning to find + the old man takes out the shadow + red to the bed
abandoned farmhouse + the old tombstone + keeps the gate the old foot
a final + takes keeps the hospital + early sky
the empty nest + heavy a train runs + dreams on the + in their son 's web
our address -- - + i nothing in the edge + a world behindâ€” + is + a fox
on the end -- + i long back + double shift -- . . . .
computer crash ... + i follow a snowflake
in the moon , dried , that graffiti ... + over + over the moon
first day of the river -- - + as the ring + in the last day
the old town -- + the last graffiti 's nest + time for a candle
august snow -- - + as away the way i left + a single magpie
summer fog -- - + she takes all stillness + + in the hardware store
it 's summer day -- - + i and the sunflowers + ... , + the moon
a butterfly , + i leave the last ticking + time for a end of bayou
