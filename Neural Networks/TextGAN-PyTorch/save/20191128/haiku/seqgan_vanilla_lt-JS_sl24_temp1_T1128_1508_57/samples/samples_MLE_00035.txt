coming suddenly + the waterfall + which cat 's eyes
fallen pot + the silence + of my tongue
floating trimming + as moonlight - + the moonlit trees
half moon -- + someone cricket alone + her saltines letters
moonless farm + dreams of a window + all journeys
midwinter dusk + my attention + curved + riding its neck
vase + long cyclamen leaves + floating
the moon 's surgery - + the same wind blows + after a hidden by white
end of washer - + onto soft blue + smell of a ripe cherry
in the train- + just the hum + of each shorter
sunset -- + a baby 's day + chickadees chatter
ebb tide + same blood shorter now + see off my face
spin cycle -- + smart phones + slightly doorway + reunion
fallen leaves + my daughter and spreads + the winter solstice
bad spring day + outside the ice , + that warriors
snow drops at the house- + freshly fried if go , still shore + the sparrow
street camp . . + the moth â€™ s skin + melts is a buzzard
festive season + watch the sandbox + hot hats motionless
morning fog -- - + the ligustrum tree + riversound
dusty pools + the hum + in thin
half moon -- + children flick marbles + in the bayou
thicker dust + in the garbage letters + player
migrating leaves -- + my wife drops from the cake + somehow smaller
bones candle + veils how beer + locked in my door
rain + the undercurrent + without more haunting
year 's smallness + she tells him the bus + side by a fox
forgetting to november coffee + a world locked in + by the rain
freight pregnant over replace + what everyone blooms + into the foliage + its old memories
morning hot day + my weight + of sunshine
chocolate + afternoon radio groans + follow the halal tears
sampling my breath + the homeless man mid-lake + pool-side
sunrise -- - + the base-runner looks reflection + new year 's deck
