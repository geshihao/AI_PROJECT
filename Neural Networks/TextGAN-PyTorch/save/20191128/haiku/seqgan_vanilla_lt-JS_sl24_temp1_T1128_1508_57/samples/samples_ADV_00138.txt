a lake + feeling the shopkeeper + tells me is me , + the stone city + to the last day
half moon -- - + i tea with us + in the ice , + to the sun
day moon - + the last of a blue sky— + the beach geese
falling fog + to the rain gathers + the year 's umbrella .
the old short lady called mary + on the bee + on the way back i
grey day -- - + i nothing here in + with the fireworks , early spring
after the slice + a homeless man gathers cans + plum is the road
a bee chose + the faint scent + of a bed red fog
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + the last bed half a warmth
my pregnant daughter + home-made old love + over the rose
morning blue sky -- - + the old friend is a missing + double turtle fall
day moon - + the old man 's love + at dawn
a bullock cart + loaded high heavy + over garbage truck + early
mandarin ducks - + a asylum seeker the + the whole truth
a lake + feeling the wallpaper peeling back , + the rainy sky
indian summer + spring fog -- - + as the intersection
east river heat + the pregnant woman + beyond the door
moving and over + the old man + subway garden
cloudy sky - + the child runs + in a satellite dish
august snow -- - + the cat only the book + old hunting shirt
slate skys + chalk mark outlines + on the moonlight
august wind + even i left - + the last blossoms
a whiff + of the door + of the coffee shop sky
summer heat + the photo of heavy mountains is her green + so shore the
the wind of summer -- - + she tells me the + the old woman ... + early the old thoughts
autumn sunset -- - + the old woman + talks without snow
the shadows + family photographs + watching the car ’ s cold + and love
monday day + over the snow 's + a diamond earing
falling mist + heavy with snow + fog out the window
even the hospital + the mountain sinks + at the window , a grey sky
a little smile + kitten left + keeps the ceremony
a lake + feeling the unfolds + all the shadow + terrorists
