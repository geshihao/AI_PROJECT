a second glass of the sidewalk her voice + all the earth shadow
summer heat + all the highlighted passages + in me
ancient at window + a blackbird tears flesh + our woman has + tickled the garden
alphabet sky . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
winter drags on . . . . + a checkerspot with me + on the moon
the thanksgiving meal - + with a gull + blue beer + flirts with the tunnel
unconcerned + with mom -- - + the silence
playing bowls , + the distance between + old gold brightly grey
winter drags + reaches at end + the sound of rain
a curve after + a tree and blue + for summer 's
after the moon + a constellation of stars + on the window
twilight - + a few leaves + on the roof
a dull ache + i have n't told mobiles + thoughts
winter drizzle + end of the road + on the way burning back on the old end
winter wind— + sound and eyes bloom + the stone women collecting + for lingering morning
pressed among the bed + a mother ’ s photo + reunion
fresh snow -- - + divorce as the warmth + she 'll quit
summer heat + the air conditioner drips + on my pumpkin + late
the seasons change + through the early trees + finally turns to us
mountain heat + drinking with coffee store + in hand is + autumn spring sky
delta blues ... + another looks + and i go hunting + winter moon
late everything + red ridges of my tongue + a scent of + time to bar
with the day - + a checkerspot in fog , + the mattress
first crowing + breaks the river + the cat 's bed
after the storm + is the silence of the wind circle and spring
day moon - + the new of a fish + on moon
brightening sky + the child 's whole + in tibetan star + fading light
a pile of winter + back in the wall + + an orange
street rain - + the silence beyond the plans + tanning salon
harvest moon ... + the garden graffiti + hard into the tunnel
summer heat + a little lost + a faucet dripping
at hail + the red patrick 's voice + train passes out + morning deep side , white wish
