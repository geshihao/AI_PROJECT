a touch + of homecoming geese + bursts into a eyes
fall + and breaks the taste + in a moth sign
confucius + a facebook cry cross grey
long night - + some smell + of a near-sighted swimmer
clacking rails + five languages + on of blackbirds of + his mother asks only
chasing bubbles + a goose honks its way + along the book the empty + to then river
summer longing + a building runs ... + trackless snow
last year end - + running out of the mannequins ' + in the mist
my mother has + somewhere in the pollen + reshaping
circling each thigh + cool into a coat of the scent + drip , drip , and snow
long i saw a stare + i scatter with blackbirds + and the temple
december rain - + sound of one + in the mist
earth day ... + we talk about when + the spring mist
a butterfly 's quest + for a anesthetic + tells me on the way burning out + the autumn light
nothing blue sky + an amish foot softly taps + in moonlight and time
in the ways + she looks at her + me in the sky
summer longing + a old leaden + sing into hand
the age + a conversation + about daffodils
long weekend over + we rebuild the roses + north buddha and fall
a black woman + light in the alamo + turning time to seed
is side of grey . . . + back with bronze temple + summer wind
martin luther king day -- - + too many women + back to night
rivulets in + to watch the shower + of mist has and manure + and snow .
a koi rises + a three-legged chair + for a saxophone
autumn snow + starts from black . . . + even the loon shatters
sunday morning . . . + a few leaf + at dawn
winter evening . . . + hanukkah + lock of mist + on redwood
rainy night -- - + a little crows + two butter needs out
winter gloomy -- - + a air conditioner drips + beyond the eyes
young lovers + a blur of crows + a call for in the wind
eating snow -- - + a snail crawls watching the warmth + in my new moon
new moon -- + she all grown at me + in the wind
