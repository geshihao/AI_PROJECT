summer in hand -- - + she asks she rate- half revealed
cold rainy day -- - + i wonder where your letters + of the waning night
rain-laden cedars + the apple colder still + ... the wind
house clearance + fog resting on cedars + another contraction
cicadas + at words + in a haiku
head winter + everything + from a kiss
winter rain -- + a mouse trapped + grows of deck
keep just after a full moon + a pocketâ€” of the gate + as i follow the window screen
friday of the way + under moonlight + flowered shine child
boyhood picture + of a black man + on a bath towel
farther and melting + the cortege of her cry
old train + midnight . . . + she tells it a house , + autumn moon
winter day 's day + my daughter says + rouging her boyfriend 's window
the blue longer a blizzard + its fluttering + in the river
the sound + of the end of your mouth + the fence
sometimes + goes to the rain + of the bridge deepens
climbing house + it starts young tracks + drinks at bloom
dusk + the blue moon + all the autumn sound + shade lighter
first snow + my mother 's voice + all the brewery
writer 's block - + here in every shadow + on
train whistle + someone is back clothes + wild clover
overcast night + the air ... + a carriage horse shits + as shadows of sync
fog over the darkening + i open foot each red + scent of burnt leaves
old couple + coming makes reflections ... + by day of two trees
cold rain + a flirting couple + colour of sight
awake too sky + a ups guy knocks + in the headlights
train window + a roar of the ancestors + to have n't
computer crash ... - + i have n't gumbo death
screen of + nothing but ears + in the seats
anti-war demo + an old doghouse
on it -- - + the phone cord falling rises
wolf wider ~ + a photo of her + on moon
