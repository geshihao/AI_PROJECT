snow and short school - + a moose tracks + along the other myself 's a drink
the sound + of the cherry blossoms + spring sun
on snow rising + with the face + a red rose chair + sound -- - + september fog
deep the stream + returns to grey drip + in the old gourd
autumn equinox - + the coffee from red snow
a few petals girl love + lost i plant in the loon shatters + the line
winter drags breeze + blowing seeds the sheets where she says + to the hospice bottles
together + we find here and wind , + the silence
half moon . . . . + white lilies cup + a happy can
she â€™ s door + the rose , leaden coat + hat less the room
rainy afternoon -- + a patch of + she asks me + back and heaven
beer bottles + clink in a cobweb + snail 's handwriting ... + is here and knife
from the ink + some autumn moon + the morning light
the light of + blooming march traffic + on the ground
summer heat + the photo of the sheets + in the river
balloon floats + in a rest
head cold - + and in the roof + between brief window - + with the funeral
deep across + blossoming garden + on the oldies station
deep snow + the night separating from the moon + only the pond
a soda can + closing the harvest moon + again
watching walk + into the grass of evening + lifting fog
deep morning -- + a carpenter mother + at summer 's over
summer rain - + a last ball + in my back lost
the name + back on a heavy life + over the world
way back and i + only because road stretches + a refugee camp
zen garden + + all the wake river bank + hard moon + rising
i open the door + a tiny lizard + the hospice truck
coffee rings left + or not you done now + into the incense
snow in the woods + across the stars and a bug + through + craters
summer heat + a homeless veteran 's + weathered sign
winter rain- + outside + the red haired woman + straddles her winter moon
spring mist + the blue sky above + ... , and snow
