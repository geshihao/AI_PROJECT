morning fog + my cell phone begins + without out crumbs
beach vacation + drift from hospital + smiles veils me
midnight -- + a mouse in barking + in iraq
on my assurances + my neighbor alone + my neck
zazen -- - + the sound of a can + in fog
so many highway - + he remembers the window + on my feet
the underside of leaves + she was curtains piano 's + essence of twilight
last firefly + the song of fireflies + the sun tastes the bedroom + on their voice
the tang of corn stretching + happy nice fresh way + in the windows
fog and rain + the same with prayer + christmas lights bloom
flu season -- + an empty house + along the party
never on the rainstorm + i listen to find + the old memories
winter solstice -- - + hard with shoe i ' miso at + valentine 's summer
bad market snap -- + a flock of from bare lights + in this sake
in the weather + again the river moon + the contrails
good friday -- + koi swim + through my keys
wood of the end + of a broken rubbish + searching
apples mill + where july afternoon + full of jasmine
first afternoon -- + i the dandelion blows + while the ice
abandoned farmhouse- + a bright shadow + barn owl
snow crocus + the drop of blackbirds + against moon
where the haikuâ€” + the china tick + unwritten
cajun weekend + a honeybee longer + in the fuselage
late night at work ? + tattoos + she is still me + in the memorial 's end
from her voice + his neighbor 's eyes burning water + from a tussock
winter solstice + the blooming neighbors + the milky way
tea apple + earth across the sky + conversation clouds
house cleaning -- - + she closes early
heavy rain + the impressionist painting rose , + the tip of perfume
cold night + a golden dot on her grandchild + scent of the sidewalk
this cold in darkness - + i make my back + high noon
squash vines + bull peeling back home
