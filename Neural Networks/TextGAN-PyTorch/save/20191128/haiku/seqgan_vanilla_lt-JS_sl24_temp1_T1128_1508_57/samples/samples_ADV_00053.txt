summer fog + up the old pond + at night
collecting shells - + the columbine still + back thoughts
the age + a train takes grey in + the rose
between the sun . . . . . . . . . . a snoring punctuated + to rain -- - deep
a long wooden pier + back away the mountain trail + home
menopause - + the taste of snow + in the old pond
wood flute music + the day leaves swirl + all the mist
snow in the darkening cold + again - + the concrete
back over the taste + in the world + has no green ... + ...
snow in the forecast -- - + a yogi does not out + the scent moon
abandoned farmhouse + a crinkled flag frayed + is a loon
autumn sky - + the mist gathers + me in the mist
tai chi - + a many there is + back in the moon
sharp fiery clouds + and a snail 's shadow + early
winter drags . . . . a fish + of a far-away land
efficiency seminar + a hint of the height marks + drift north
sunday snow - + day shadows + the blur of snow + over the field
winter dusk - + i gull - + a teacup wheel is just + and a towel
winter breeze + turquoise cigarette
a few petals + left at me + in the mist
railroad tracks + a newborn colt tries up + left for the bayou
sunday morning fog + fog on the bare lights + scatter with snow . . . deep
february sun - + the scent of cancer + pray
summer heat + a red book high . . . + a faucet dripping
a young deer + i wish i find + my friend direction
snow on the fog + up voices + in the gate to keeps + the moon
half asleep - + a kid comes out + the wind
winter drags + pallets of life + all my back back + for me to a drink
october daisy + lingering + half a mirror , clean laundry + + the on a rest
spring winter + wind and + neighbor and melting + on the pony â€™ s path
even the end - + of distant coppertone + back and a towel
from summer rain + the scars + of light + in a sky
