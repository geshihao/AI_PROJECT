summer heat + a yellow flower floats + in the sand
autumn evening - + a little boy watches + she baths
frosty sky + the child ’ s lights + without up the tunnel
good 's umbrella . . . + a yellowed postcard + changes memories
summer fog -- - + i head out + in the mist
open window + a cat comes back + watching the old gourd
twilight - + haze from the last + blue heron moves + at me
winter - + lingering scent + of the bed
a long wooden pier + lifting + even to hide
sudden grey day - + floating in the ways + the same graffiti
summer firelight + the new month girl + in the song
dusty knickknacks + mother 's wife + the teenager behind + on pepper
butterfly -- + all paintings tilted + …someone ? . . . . . day
pinned dark in + heavy with snow + of a lie
morning snow + the gravedigger latches the door + of the door
cold moon -- + the end of the path + to a high-tension wire
washday gossip— + lost heavy over homeless used to be + spring scent
back home + the slow hand on of the train + room moon
first snow -- + all paintings tilted + slightly off center
summer evening + ... horses browse + through my breasts + in snow
april , s baseball farm + umbrella sign - + a snail 's eyes - + is dipped higher and rain
blizzard - + a sweetness + a single magpie
november blossom -- + the light in + of the train
falling maple + mother earths skin + to birds
the old door - + a magpie runs ...
summer 's end— + without i could give you my practice rise + on the whiskers
surfing waves + a diamond alone + the daffodils nodding
nobody here + a little can + in the mist
august wind + back away + a half moon
summer longing + a shadow tree + tracks of wine is passed - + even the table
summer walk + in the river + i 'll go hunting
all saints day -- - + i men on the platform + my breath begins
