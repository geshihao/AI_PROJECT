mountain leaf + fallen just wanders + aimlessly
after the leaves + with egrets in + the meadow is smile + in the mist
what passion you had , + the stallion 's bed + the butterfly
winter rain- + men on her eyes + a squinting day
sunday morning mist + the scars + of crows , + in her end
late november farm + end— at the window + the garden
a long wooden pier sea + a homeless man looks up + over the + into snow
a lake + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple a house
driving home + the child 's lights + to the hospice bottles
deep the train -- + all rainstorm + and path + the night
after no cricket ... + the old fresh man + at five dollars
here and there + a swollen tick + on the cover
snow and wish deep snow + the fog has she last + on the mountain notch
a curve in the fog + bees ' + on the moon
in silence + a kick in the sky + a midge
a walk to meet + the old leaf + a crocus
late night cold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
autumn snow + the tenderness + of cicadas
silence - + the joy of the rise + drifts between + the silence
east river gift gleams thick + in a book of the sky + cold moon
morphine drip + i wake her apology + spring sun
first snow - + the postman + eyes
i campfire + long tea ; + a checkerspot in old + to me
autumn wind + a blackbird 's reflection + the same question twice
snow crocus + the lingering beach train + on bare land
rainy baltimore + nest back into the sky + ice through + just before
deep old sun + the taste of a loon shatters + i are unfair
twilight - + the warmth of falling snow + on the shadow
harvest moon ... + the jogger 's stride + the cold moon
stupid arab - + all the ways + she starts out
first snow -- - + the barmaid kisses me + through the pond + moon
breakup — + my neighbor 's husky + snail 's red
