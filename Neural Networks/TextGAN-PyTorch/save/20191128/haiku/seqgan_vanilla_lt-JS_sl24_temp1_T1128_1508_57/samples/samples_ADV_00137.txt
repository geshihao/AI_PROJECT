the autumn woman + back as the harvest homeless + + with a alien
indian summer + the scars + of unfinished poems
the breeze + drifts past + somewhere else
a dry heatâ€” + after over the night + a new moon
the red singer + takes effect 's talk + and enough fog
morning fog -- - + the old woman says + your leg
coffee only the day -- - + the beetle i + two passengers than love + house
crowded train -- + the old man gathers + the lettuce
in fog and night + the river bank + a hint of the window
the police car . . all cherry blossoms + in the vase + plum is me
your husband -- - + she 's left + in the river
cold day - + the old man 's + minimal is the end the tracks
a final + unused than the branch i , + a youth , + soak standing
cold moon -- - + she 's left + at the last is the window , + trackless snow
gibbous moon -- + i came back as love + over the last moon
first day of the day + even the cyclamens + the child 's last day
the old woman , + a grey man 's voice
sunday fog at the day -- - + running all the sky + time to the bed
summer heat + the little garden + floats on the garden
a dry maple leaf + early and i + reshaping
way back of + the silence + the spring fog
the cut hat + old wish + all the bug a house , girl in the gate + nehru smiles earing
in the ruins + in the wind , the loon shatters + the rose bush
parking old love - + a way in the railings + on the door
deep snow + the sun reaches the city window + a rainbow in the old man
cold fog -- - + the smell of the last + last graffiti . . . . . . .
storm -- - + the last memories + old start
the rushing river -- + a flat finish + in her ear
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in the window , the sound
snowy dawn ... + the old woman + about more back , this time
a furniture store - + snowflakes , + in the loon
the old town appears -- - + the king of many fish + horse 's regular chirp is i ' + in a cigarette
