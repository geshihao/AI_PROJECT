first time -- + the sound of + long wind
the day hides at + the day moon + the river of the open
soccer championship + the magnolia-tree here - + cover a towel
snow and short roses + blooming with year ... + purple rhododendrons + nailed to a pencil
the family gathered— + a curl of incense + back in the way + hat less
equinox - + dreams of the house + old time
windy day -- - + the old rolodex + slow soft
first day of summer -- - + some one river + as the old plant-pot .
a long stories + the aftertaste + umbrella day
the old fingernails spins + all crows tulips + the rose
the way from the bed + the waterfall + bird can
rain at the hour + coffee appear + the church 's hand
sunday fog at the beach- + the old woman + old enough for fog
first day of the river + we another cheek ... + the mist + spring weeds
summer heat + the retirement brightly + bursts
cold night + the persistent warmth + with the wind
leaves garden + + the singing of birds + over the bed
another sky -- + a bee + in the incense
sunday morning fog + without the windshield -- - + your fresh snow
dusty seashell + the silence + back and decaf + over the incense
summer fog + the system of wine + is lowered at sunset
tea earth + in the river bank + a flattened possom before
in the river + the small fire + on the table
red sky- + all day moon + the summer day
sultry day - + the sound of the shadows of + river count the homeless
the name + i remember to me + of the moon
summer heat + the crinkled edges + does to liqueur half snow . . .
a lake + feeling the taste + of the bottom of the old as ago
meteor shower -- - + the old silence + at the wind
woman touches the door -- - + the new barber is + the pony ’ s lines
high tide + a flattened possom + back
a lake + gentians . shadow room + the garden moon
