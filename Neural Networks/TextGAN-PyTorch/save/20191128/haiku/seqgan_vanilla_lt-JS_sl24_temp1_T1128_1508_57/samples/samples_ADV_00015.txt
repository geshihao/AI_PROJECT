awake clouds + smell - + we take off my back lights out + rising
at the moon -- + the wind pushes a youth buried + this falling geese
heavy rain + an antique scale + weighing dust
the seasons change + ... horses browse + through his feet
a fiery train + at the path + she talks in + sharp reach
refugees walk + along train tracks + by a doll
summer rain . . . i could give you her + in the sky
desert wind + men on the platform + alone appear
wildflowers + in the edge + of the roses
a dried lotus leaf + in tibetan notes : + out the dark
a kona + of its bottle + on her blouse
long i saw my pee + stays too tea + and wind
with thunder -- - + as i brush the wind + winter light a end
season 's end ... . . . + now enough i + only the puppy
winter day - + summer moths + on her knees
red lobster- + each all our love + opens the latin mass
a teacup + through pepper + only slice the ground
dead moon -- + the empty clouds drift + on the red
spring fog -- - + a little cat still + a faucet dripping
the old childhood bloom ... + a smoker finds still me + in the roof gutter
a touch + of the world + rose scented old path +
between downpours + sweet iraq -- + a greenfinch moves + in a willows
baby rabbit - + in her bra . . . deep + in the mist
snow flurries - + i eat + fog to the sun
washday gossipâ€” + fluttering out + a garbage bag
emptied table + a hot drop of holes -- + winter moon
from the way only , spray + along the twelve-carriage platform : + september fog
saturday night fog -- - + some passengers + broken promises
this day of the oscars- + of the branch back , + all i remember + lifting fog
scent of home + we enter the island + the blind horse
blizzard - + the magic mushrooms + between proud
night sky . . . + back and forth in our tears + again
