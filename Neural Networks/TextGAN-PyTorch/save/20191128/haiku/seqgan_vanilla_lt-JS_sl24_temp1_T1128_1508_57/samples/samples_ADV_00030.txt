among the gravestones + with raindrops + on today 's snow
a spider web + her seasonal cookies + eaten one by one

far cheek puddle + the oak tree + long graffiti ... + at the tunnel
a flagpole stands guard + before me + in the desert train
from summer morning + almost school ' + on the cheek
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + a police car window
melting snow - + all the ways + sound moon
