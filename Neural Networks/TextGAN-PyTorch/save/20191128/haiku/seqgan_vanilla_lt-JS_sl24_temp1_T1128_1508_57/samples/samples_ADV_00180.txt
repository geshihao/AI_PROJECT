sunny day + the day pauses as i + too many fingers
faces from the last day of the moon , just i could give you so hand + dancing on the last way back i
summer heat -- - + i leave the last + scent of light
sunset traffic . . i find + the smell of old lights + to the sea
winter drags on . . . + how many kisses + the child 's window
falling fog -- - + the scent of + thoughts of fog
i long day , the end ... + the half moon + on a sheet
not one again . . . . + i just and love stick , + we no butterflies
a sunrise hold - + scent of the bridge lights i as i meant to pluck . . i + a cup of the
long sunday day of the moon + the small shadows at the scent + drip , hardly hair
back over the taste + of the door + a shadow moon + over stone angels
a returning i . . . + i look at the window , red rain
on the hotel gift - + the christmas lights + the flight is me
summer fog + in the way the incense stick + sitting in the ceiling + : + old time

summer heat + the barber is + the contrails
passing moon - + the silence between me + in the window , a buzzard
a side of cantaloupe air + the air conditioner drips + over snow
shoots of seaweed , + the beer truck stops + is cold + to the window , red
a lake + halfway i hand has a woodpecker + flings address + time
dividing the orchard + trees - + the silence
