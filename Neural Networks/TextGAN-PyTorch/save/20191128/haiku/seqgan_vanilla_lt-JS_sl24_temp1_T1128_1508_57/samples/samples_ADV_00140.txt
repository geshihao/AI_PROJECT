delta blues -- + the moon carries + in the old + gate up
snow outside + the taste of day + under a book + coffee
sunset -- - + the scent + of the green heat gathers + a pencil sky
autumn snow -- - + the young pale hand + and a passing cloud
perseid showers + running the barber , + the river 's name
a dark blue + in the last blossoms + back and loaded
a lake + feeling the raising the way the rose + returning geese , â€˜ n seek
the old woman , + slow i have i + april rain
spring mist + the man 's talk + at garbage truck + + pear is the mountain sun
summer longing + a shooting star + plum blossom is the early

freight train -- - + burning with one + as embers snoring + to a snowflake
rainy sky -- - + the homeless man gathers cans + plum is the moon
a butterfly , + the first tea gets drift + over the other + old rainy day
falling fog -- - + the child runs + the whole to stillness
fresh tea i . . . + just the old eyes + under the tunnel
extreme cold weather -- - + wind with a red sky- + the cherry blossom is + thoughts of the tunnel
a butterfly , smell + the scent of coffee , red stop + last blossoms
