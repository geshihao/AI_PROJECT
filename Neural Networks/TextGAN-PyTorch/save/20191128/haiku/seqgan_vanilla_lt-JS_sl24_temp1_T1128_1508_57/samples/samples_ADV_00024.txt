traffic out + a man standing tracks + at the valley
the blank page + learning to , silent + faces peep through the sky . + fishing much
driving home + underfoot the wood + in the funeral
a rainy season house + she 's woman , a lamp + of the puppy

snowstorm + drifts + through sand dunes + the wind
a maple needs + unpacking winter in + do out
forgetting the way + with the moon + on a saxophone
walking at funeral -- - + christmas lights the hands + with the sea

summer sky -- - + a few tentative nest + in the window
mountain leaf + extra sugar + in heavy time
just one behind here and tar + the gentle rise and closes the ice + on the mist
putting diamonds + on the way in me + a red garden
all saints day - + hot tired balloon + in the family tea
a raven sun - + a snail 's edge + staring for a tulip
a name + four skin a platform + this morning light
failing light -- + the moon dances + in the autumn moon
summer sidewalk - + all the end of a breeze + on a saxophone
may clouds + she boats pierces + by 20 summers
summer fog ... + red in my girl + staring up the over + over the mature corn
stone of the top of sunset -- - + i faded on her eyes + a dropped iris
a familar name + on the face + against the sea
in a mile + of the net + the cat blues
a whiff + of the end + the bride biopsy hour the room
flowing estuary + native languages + thoughts
