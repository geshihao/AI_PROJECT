cold moon - + the woodpecker ’ s ’ s setting + ' ’ s late
the name + from the church blues
the old cranes up + fog resting on cedars + over the lot
winter evening + a faint leaf + a dragged closed
between sky + the old air + from a tussock
burning leaves -- - + a gm car + late in the house
summer 's end + the sharpness in hand + turns a train window + the spring day
desire + the thump of a bee + slow to kill
deep wrinkles + at a blue heron + at me
morning haze . . . . + new snow 's left + wild orchids the old sun
moon-paved road + a flock of cedars + turns over the + dreams
alongside a flirting couple + in the window
winter drags on . . . + some one took a platform + shifts louder
roasted coffee + the scent of + old gold turns up
alabaster moon + on the headlights + the river top
on lake - + a silver of kona + in the river
summer rain . . . . + i visit + the parents , so proud + over the house
falling fading + feast everything + becomes summer heat
driving to meet + the lingering beach train + pictures ...
rainy car sun chair + with a snail crawls meet along + the cherry blossoms
winter rain + a teacup of dusty + recovers
autumn mist + the magpie + monochrome
the moon - + heavy with + neighbor is an + someone 's left a book
a lake + feeling the midnight . . . + a white pregnant morning
the trainyard at roofs -- + the scarecrow 's hands + starts with fog
half moon -- - + your tea cup + the winter light
winter evening + a patch our bed + a blue sky break + the world
no dawn says , + the way i just + gliding moves the salt + till the rainbow
solo trip + on the past dissolves + dancing between the flood
my mother sign miso ? , + he gives me + she 's warmth of sky + a loon
slipping in + the very mist + of the moon
winter day - + snow on the shower + of us is love
