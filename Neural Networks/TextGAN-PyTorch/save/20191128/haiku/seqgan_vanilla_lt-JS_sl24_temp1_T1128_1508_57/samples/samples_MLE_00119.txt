migrating geese— + i try to read the spider + for a single leaf
nénuphars + un poisson en sautant + accroche la lumière
hovering grey into + in the moon + at guantanamo bay
the rail tracks + toward very the highway + a calm cat 's sun
a hazy window + this day + in the book
still pond -- + a police kisses + at a stranger
bent like a puzzle + of the bride + in the intersection + and names and rain
the breeze + through assembled on- + once again
he kissed me + on the windows + in her address
after the road + all the sun . . . + a couple plantation + used to be ' room
january afternoon - + a fallen leaf + lost up another
falling heat + that donkey 's braying + filled with pain ?
rememberance service - + as the blue moon + chewing again
the budapest square -- + a glimmer of youth buried + over my glove
day after + the old temple + end of the moon
i arrange my tie + to hide
snow in my bed- + out of the promenade + cat has a raindrop + down the night
all day - + the only scent + he gets married rice tighter
no child -- + gone up my eye + the dog finds
september thunder ~ + her mascara + to sun
overcast day -- - + the blur of insects + against the map
olive border + talking of the + moon on the wind
dawn - + a swollen tick + into the ground
the familiar wail + of the trench of the mourning dove : + well fed
playing bowls , + how wish + a half her voice
rain + the same earth + wind
morning tai chi ~ + a jogger 's stride + the evening cool tide + still september
runnig water + at the door + smell of flour + clouds for a nail
more piercing + in the wet lingering morning + then
pale moon - + the man standing outside + the scent of + rose
morning fog + filling up fog + the summer evening
through my words + the sun reaches in the moon + morning stillness
