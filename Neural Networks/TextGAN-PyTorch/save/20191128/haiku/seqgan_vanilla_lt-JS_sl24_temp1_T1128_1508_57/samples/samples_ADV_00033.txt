washday gossipâ€” + bright shadow + lipstick + in the hand ...
the empty house + but i needle off my sake + ice cream truck + break

steady morning + only rain + the earth flies silently
cloudy red + i sleep ... . . . + just dull light a book
scattered mist + weathered truck + blocked by billboards

one moon , + all the bottle + a jumping fish
the recession -- - + a baby drops the + morning snow
honoring those bone + thoughts + and i eyes
in stone leaves + the taste of seaweed + left the moon

rush hour + we i saw a bus + a little more sand is hunting shirt
on the produce aisle -- - + the way in our tears + at the wind
solstice + two passengers window + late time
summer longing + a curl shifts from + the gravedigger latches the door + and spring rain
blistering heat + a few tentative dreams + she talks in + nobody in its shadow
behind something parts + grey cold + over the colour + of blue a wake stone out
