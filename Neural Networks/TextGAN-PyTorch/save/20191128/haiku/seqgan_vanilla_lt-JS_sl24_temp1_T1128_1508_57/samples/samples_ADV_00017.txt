a rail tracks + bark stones .
black friday + reaches light on the taste + of the edge red
huddled smokers -- + my barber , rose , + summer black good + old do
winter rain- + with birds -- - + the tranquil moon
winter june - + only ones with shoes + back into the day
still lightning + i to meet through the breeze + closing me
secrets -- + burrowing in snow on a red
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
grey sky -- - + the whistle of a few leaves flutter + on
winter stars - + with the koi up + over the pond
a mosque -- november dusk + parted shadows of a hound 's howl + mother 's window
last station forget + in a lizard 's ribs pressed + against concrete
autumn day + without a line of the bed + a curl of beach birds + behind the wind
around the moon + the river bank + in the young web moves + in the bedroom
migrating geese— + i sip my brother + again
sultry day - + a tiny soap bubble rises + the seagull side + in the sky
harvest moon . . . + i even right water ... + sold out
summer firelight + the child . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i a cyst -
rain settles + two island in the incense + unknot
summer love . . . + all the scent + of the mist
a second glass of train -- - + she reads up the colour + autumn moon
hold me tight a girl + in the river bank + in the sky
way back goes + i add his can + just in a wall
a long wooden pier + lingering , used to find + the silence
to lead a moor + inside the name called a bus + a stack of of grey
the dry maple + starts drifts + after heavy snow -- - + cover a neon cross
the path shorter + my mother - + at twilight— + he mother
scent of rain - + rain in the chestnut + fills with very sweet
a tea bag , + in the village lights half moon + into moon
southend-on-sea + freshly fried + saw the loon shatters + another contraction
autumn twilight + up the dove 's grave + —tell way
abandoned farmhouse + a farmer on the nails + in a beer truck + electric summer
