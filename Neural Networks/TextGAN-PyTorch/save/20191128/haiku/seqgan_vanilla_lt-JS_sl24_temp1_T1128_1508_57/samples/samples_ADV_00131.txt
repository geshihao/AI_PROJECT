the clattering + of lake + till the fruit
the curved cheek + back in the family , red we trust + over the way + thoughts
winter light + at summer 's day + early sky
day moon -- - + all the light of + far he runs ...
twilight - + over the last blossoms + summer moon
the taxi driver + returning up + over the wall
death of the fog , + the smell of snow + cat over passing
all an affair— the train + early in a coat the old + rose
a sandbox + i walk to a raindrop moon + the mist
morning fog -- - + the train is a sparks + over the train
veins of you , a flight + as it out the beds
a cold way + a carriage pony takes effect ... + over the mist + over the mirror
summer 's end— + without the window + one in the old bed
in the ruins + the moon in the way + to the fedex man at the wall
after the early hour + pattering on the day + old memories
moon gazing + along the sunrise - + scent of the window , red
the snow shifts + the world locked in the wall + advents out the tea
winter rain + the gull 's day + almost over the window + old memories
the age + the old love + silent moon
last a end -- + the faint scent + goes in fog
night shift - + old wish , + the homeless man on grey
the plane 's landing lights + i '' + the smell of grey direction
the old woman , + an old woman , gas runs + dried festival
the pastor 's day -- - . . . + on a grey day
last blossoms - + some passengers , leaden coat + over the solstice
removing her wedding , + the old garden + lingers in the dragonfly
red sky- + the last page
a lake + feeling the midnight . . . + playing the sauce simmers
the empty nest + over the old friend + even the loon shatters + the door -- -
three shades too the day + is dipped deeper + with river runs
summer heat + the crinkled edges + in yellow snow
ring around the fog , + slow many seeds sprout + in the cold window
