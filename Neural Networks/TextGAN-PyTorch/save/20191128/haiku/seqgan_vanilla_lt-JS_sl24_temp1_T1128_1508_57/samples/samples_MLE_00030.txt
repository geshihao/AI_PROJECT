silent night + a near-sighted swimmer , + still ill jar without trees
piles of my bed- + glowing lean coffee drift + the ice
folding chair + papyri in hand
crescent moon + turquoise deepens + starry night
gentle breaths -- + the phrase in my day 's + a helmut of bruises
june church . . . ... + through the way train
dawn -- - + no blue watch + the old leaf 's headlights
snowstorm— + blow poverty + her gold
mayflowers + stick drinking windows + this cold rain
crowded subway + the breeze bottles + someone he clutches a tussock
harvest moon + a lullaby of one + elsewhere
cloud cup + through of the sky + new twist
dying spring day -- - + a ex-girl eggs + makes because of by one tan
veins of skyline + after my eyes on the end + wind-puffed primroses
prairie ... + what i moonlight— + to fresh other dream
as a lemonade + knights through + falling leaves
starry night . . . + a nude clouds + light in the sunlight
morning she break - + no one has arrived + + of the gin bottle
frozen pond -- + another new twist + but not worth payment
a statue darkened path + down stars through the sky + into dusk
stars at dusk -- - + through the island someone + she pencils in + their cup of color
spring sun - + just after the distance + drifts downstream
war ’ s daily winters + the turned machine + my windows
on cedars ~ + a gentle graffiti looks . + at the silence
no buddha 's end + that graffiti catches + carrots together
january walk + after a train passes + moonless night
nun and home + the kettle shrieks + its doghouse
my mother cries + and thrives - + too tea again
summer seeds + each blue names + circles in the ice
high tide -- + slowly everything + autumn 's extra kiss
morphine buried + a murmur of the old + left to warm green
subway cold + the next to look in the + on cool silence
