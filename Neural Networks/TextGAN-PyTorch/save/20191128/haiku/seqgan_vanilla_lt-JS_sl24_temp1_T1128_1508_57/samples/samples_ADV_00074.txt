starting a second child drowned + and the scent of fog
the utter house + the phone cord + back for earth
summer heat + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
the morning sun + on a windharp + the city sky
summer longing + a few dewdrops on + with cicada shells
snow flurries -- + my favorite fat + for me a neon code
snow on the glow + not and mary + only red gloves
the path of + again + of distant coppertone air + on the rest
' room - + the train runs + on the moon
the old line + we enter the last dreams + of the world
the old learning + reading a sudden much + of sea
the family gathered— + a maw snuves + sings off
fallen heat + i start hoarding sake
the brush + back and approaching the pond + and spring is `` good time
the end gate . . all sound + in the trail of + without the old dodge
winter grass -- + a wide expanse of lawn -- - + red break
summer heat + a homeless man gathers cans + urban teeth
the curved cheek + a forgotten camp + summer 's summer
falling mist + ... away here + spring in my world
drifting fog + the persistent warmth + of the train
my son 's eleventh birthday -- + patch cedars + reflects a sun does does + in the moonlight
a noon fat slower too window - + a birthday 's screams
summer 's end— + what lost i follow them - + walking into the tune
wildflowers + to the blue sky + spring weeds
coming up - + a morning dew deepens
morning fog -- - + she 's warmth + ice foxes + are billows
summer 's end— + another shadow + goes in another
gaza at twilight… + cool train is is out + a magpie
sunrise -- - + a fox 's left + in the wind
winter drags . . . . is + he scent + in the old gourd
red dragonflies + gather burning into the fog + of a sky
a hundred streets named + peachtree - just a cat + thoughts of snow
