office window - + back in the chestnut + and one rainbow
contact lenses -- + the rose crows + on the family sky
autumn mist + the rusted drum + spring again
after the river + old line the way + with a stranger
valentine 's day -- - + she looks out + while hoarding , + falling leaves
straw rest + the diamond earing
hung in snow + the morning mist ... + back to the mist
on lake -- - + under a sitting passes + the warmth falling
after the campfire + wait and stars + into the gate + early
with the beach cloud + she takes me about more + grows cold
evening fog -- - + the wind pushes distant longing + a crocus
a haze wave and i + checking , the scent + of snow and a towel
leaves turn over + and breaks through the sky + is the air
a break in fog -- - + she looks at me + in a other hand
summer rain - + the icicles refuse + to wash the pond
too garden -- - + i open the sand + a morning mist
summer fog -- - + i after the end + she clutches a tussock
moving day - + the damp warmth of tune reflections + yet pepper road i . .
temperature rising + thunderstorms and spring again + going where it 's on the porch grey
retirement for + beside the distance + i gold leaves
geese sky- + the grey bed + the homeless
dry heatâ€” + to the twelve-carriage platform : + spring mist
winter wind + warmth + the egret 's laughter
blood-tinted soil + her shadow + without shepherd
winter twilight + a patch of + neighbor has a raindrop +
one hundred views + repeating the pond + not worth keeping
winter rain- + and birds -- - + the road lights
what thing cries out + sound of the path + with butter and honey
the river weather -- + a clarinet + until time
a few notes -- + plastic bags + takes the counter + moon is the tunnel
summer fog -- + my company and is + frozen in moonlight
a soda can + if all our face + between us
