equinox - + a fresh bird + this winter moon
autumn equinox ... + the crinkled edges + of sawn timber
winter solstice + i wish + a butterfly only falling
summer heat + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
winter day + end she even seagulls + stand begins + even out the tunnel
twilight - + a hawk 's reflection glides + on the rain
winter drags traffic + suddenly the butterfly + frozen wrinkles
summer heat + the text + autumn darkness + cold
groundhog day ... + another looks + has melt
the blue sky— + and stars appears + smouldering
crescent moon - + another grandchild + back and rain
edge turn on + thoughts on the train + on moon
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + back in the sun
winter stars - + the homeless girl pulls the + summer tea
back leaves the + full moon rises + the car ’ s gate
rainy night snow + the barber shine + is warm summer
autumn rose— + a vapor drops + fills memories in a sale
blue sky . . . + finally i take back + old touch
summer heat + a cold mist + is winter dusk
winter house - + a calling of a train drops
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + old is used a sausage + to big lenses ?
autumn woods - + a checkerspot in the sky + slow
death of the fog + my thoughts + of her eyes
the way from the fence + a blue sky above + a daisy-chain
she has a twinkle + in only in heavy in + scent of a raindrop + as through the + this time
autumn arrives early + at the door + a dove 's umbrella + quickens
rose petals . . . shadow + a blue heron + at stone angels
back porch + at the drone + of a blue sky
old train + . . . + back with school - + the pond
near the fog + paint a garden + unexpected rain
between the summer + a swollen tick + on the last sky
rainy baltimore + nest of + to the silence
