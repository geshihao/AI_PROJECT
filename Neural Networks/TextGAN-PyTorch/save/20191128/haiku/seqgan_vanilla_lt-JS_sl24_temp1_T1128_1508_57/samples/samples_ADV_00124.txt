the passing fence - + the old woman shifts more + back
the blue pads off the branch bare late-afternoon life + a air conditioner + heavy thoughts
windy day -- - + the smell of a shower + & i walk going , hiroshima
mountain road + the flight goes back + over the pond
first moon - + the grand fire + old yard
summer heat + the blackbird words i + half-green , half-gold
