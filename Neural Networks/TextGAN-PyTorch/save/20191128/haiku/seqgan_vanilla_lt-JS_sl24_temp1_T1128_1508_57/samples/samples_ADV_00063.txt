the blank friend + as the way the rise + at the gate into bloom
i add + blooming petals love story + the silence
hunter 's wind : + just enough + in the silence
morning tea + and passengers bagels
winter park - + seed packet left fall
summer sun - + the scent of + scent of a moonless grey
empty thaw may fog : + the warmth + she tells me + from the way back
in patches of fog + the lingering call + in his backhoe
the rain storm ... + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
gibbous moon -- + rush light moon + in the sky
the blank words + a walk to the wind + for the old gourd
leap year - + the moon is still the + wind-puffed primroses
california poppies -- - + the silence + she has daffodils + near the family
a bee chose + through a cowbell + the sky !
rainy afternoon -- + going at me + an empty feet
drunk tonight -- - + a couple eye stones + snowflakes blowing way
birding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
summer heat + a shower of birds + towards the + pictures of lunar dust
windswept afternoon -- - + all those hand + a calm maple goes direction
winter solstice + ... horses browse + through the sky
deep morning chores + the orange only + of the pond + again
california dreaming + air + on the counter red moon + over the name
i add + all the wind paints the wind : + summer heat
a teacup + drifts up + with the way back to rain
snow in the forecast -- - + a first love stick + on the gin bottles
rainy dawn + a moth sign + in her eyes
warm summer 's life + follow a half hot soup + untouched
steam billows + through the blinds + forest 's headlights
moon-paved road + a common loon- + i buried
still winter day - + only sip of the red runs + back and slow and dusk
drinking mulled heat + i let the back tears + and me + in the mist
spring mist + a glimmer of wine ... + ; + to the moon
