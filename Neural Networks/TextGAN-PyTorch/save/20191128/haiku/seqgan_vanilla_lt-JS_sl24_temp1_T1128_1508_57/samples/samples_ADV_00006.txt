the moon rises early + + all the station + only in my mother
remembering summer -- + the year 's luscious green + covers the is back + brush the winter
morning fog -- - + she 's reflection + in the train
at dusk ... + a computer keyboard + over garbage truck + lost . . . . . . . . . . .
a steady rain + the lingering scent + drip , drip , drip , white list
winter wheat + blossoms comes + as we were us
early spring air + the blackbird alone and war + on the road
morning mist + caught in a hurricane 's cry
enlightment -- + a police car + not meet
eyeing + in the fog + looking into a gate + for a book
driving to a night + memory of the trees + saved , + snow
moonless night -- + a second dreams . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the rail tracks + toward a woodpecker + pumpkin ’ s + tail to heaven
awake + sad in french change + and moonlight . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
cold autumn - + in + of fish is littered + fireworks
the budapest steps + a warmth of the forest + late september
morning haze -- - + she tells him + the river of a wall
spring chill + a little higher + winter rain
a mosque -- + all the top lifts + smell of a hand + of silence
summer evening - + the last words + still so touch
the pastor 's day + behaving passes ... + on the moon
snow field + with a teacup + yet nothing fog
midnight— + a cereus cactus opens + over passing + of moon
humid morning . . . + the scratchy play + tanning salon
dinner at window + a yogi does + in a construction site + the river
overtime . . . + just find the old barn : + this winter dust
garden work— + talking to my roses + somewhere in the hands
moving into the fog + he remembers + to my father love
autumn chill - + the old man 's pale harness -- + + trees dreams
autumn colors -- + a gray sound + of a temple
mountain ’ s name + she wears that scent + of the morning coffee
amish gentleman 's + lingering scent + of the night
