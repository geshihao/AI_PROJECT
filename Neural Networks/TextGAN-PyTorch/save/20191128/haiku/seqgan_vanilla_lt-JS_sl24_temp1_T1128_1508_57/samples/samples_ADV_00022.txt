woodland graffiti + ... how snow + in a raindrop a land
in a cow passes we eyes + is the counter top
eaves + someone vomits beneath + the last mist
october fog -- - + i open me + in the sun .
summer heat + breaches gravel + of confession
hard times + the barber to rest + in the snowman
a puddle + nest bitter + a helmut of fog
the way fog and + all the storm , so breath + in the fuselage
an old cricket , + finally nothing is + deep in the moon
circle of pines + in the tea can + in the park
we sip sweet snow + the sad arc + beyond the garden
summer 's end + the tenderness + of me
snow and walk + another beach train + on the light
heavy rain + the graveyard train + on a neon cross
blister moon ... + the ebb and flow + of melon
spring mist + my granddaughter 's hands + with snows
fresh snow -- + just dull light time
harvest moon -- + shadows between the shoe boxes + her wedding shadow
haiku potato friend - + the smell of sunscreen + are increasing
ten below zero : + air + smiles from geese
ash wednesday + egg and bare foot + a bug a bird sky
end of the clouds . . . + back with bird-song + and out the daffodils
summer blue sky -- - + the finally refugee i warm for mountains + on the sky
a discolored carefully + white few petals + the window-cleaner 's blade
under blood stars + a dog 's ribs pressed + against concrete
winter day -- - + all the thunder + last coffee
walden pond -- + the end of the wonder + and wild berries
grey day + ... horses browse + through the day
autumn moon + another looks + takes me on the lawn -- - + cover a gull
summer evening - + a little sake + and sweet
first day - + the scent of + moon in the family garden
grey farm + a spider man takes him + in the river
