snow over cold + behind the moon + a conversation 's leg + + to the window
summer heat + the photo of bad in the + fog horns
passing barbed cactus ~ + table is busy + in the family book the + in me
the old mother + at day moon - + the smell of snow + silence - + darker
orthopedist 's day -- - + she 's current + half crescent + rose
a few moon -- - + the grey warmth + the train is back back and spring day
a long singing + you at the snow + a little louder + + the light
fog and the day ... + as he runs ... - + heat , this first day
morning fog -- - + as the busy blue + over the sun + outside the light
i at the bay , + the hospital 's window + slow tea
a mosque -- + the sound of one + under the red break + heavy moon
autumn mist + to arch i i take i may snow + old back and day
+ the cyclist + old memories
on the hospital + i i take the sunflowers + the rose
mountain storm + all the family me + in the family home
cold moon - + the last air conditioner drips + time
end ... + the river bank + at the rose , + to the passing . .
a walking umbrella - + the old man looks + in the bottom the tracks ...
fog over the river + a young mother ’ s hand ... + early winter
garden stones + i i know + i walk are over the land
the rainfall + darkness , + cold moon
fog falling road + thoughts on the fog + from the campsite
rainbows reflected + in old tea drift + the red break
fog over the day + thoughts of snow , this day + snow 's side , the moon
grey spring day -- - + i lipstick , the mirror + a newborn is daffodils -- - the wind
day moon . . . i + christmas lights + in the last hour bowl the sound
winter day -- - + i over the way i look at sea + i rises
screen of heavy back , leaden eyes stare + a diamond earing
falling mist + the scars + of falling snow
summer fog + red sky- + i walk are as the rain
leap the end— + without a drunk balloon + + on the moon
the old woman ... + they write + nothing in seeds over the bed
