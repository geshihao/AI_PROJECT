the thanksgiving meal - + new garden open + for eating the rising + the bronx zoo
remembering traffic out + she brings his relapse : + south florida in wildflowers
driving to meet + the first end of a moor + dripping glides + wrapped ...
my name + if at the last drops as i + same butterfly
september 11th + someone to me + stars and sunshine
our address sale -- + suddenly a poppies + about silence
july sunset + my thoughts rise + a winter daydream
breaking the highest branch + through meet of the pond + he shine cry
unknotting + a can to pluck burn them - + are winter solstice
dividing the fence + a blonde + nine dogs
harvest moon ... + the old photo of the last phrase + flutters in a moonless night
failing light -- + a gray blossoms + thunder pursues it .
moonless night -- + a beetle can + wild orchids bloom
a neat pile + of fish is + snow on the leaves
evening sky + the wet lingering beach + even me among it is go the glare
new housing -- + hammer and saw + she 's way home + on the back
a bee chose + the empty bus + is that smiles all
first snow -- + the wind pushes and birds + from the practice field
the spider 's laughter + the flight of old thick + cup of cool
spring morning + finding i pass bitter + cover
spitting from the edge + of a new crop of old + for sweet bridge
failing light gate + the sound of the clouds , + first robins
in smell + forgotten 's end + we 're become visible
alphabet soup - + the silence + between second hand ticks
street light sway ~ + she talks about off + the crescent
hot city window + a flock of scattered houses + without shepherd
harvest moon + a rush goes into + another call for in bloom
in the end + of the grass blade + fireworks !
morphine drip + she 'll come lost
a thanksgiving meal - + far up the open + of falling leaves
the clatter + of scar tissue— + bisected ’ s funeral
little pawprints + in the car + migrating weeds thoughts
