a few weekend + and a snail stretches + without the time
autumn clouds - + back and bird-song + watching the mountain notch
summer fog + thoughts shaping and + checking , a loon shatters
autumn equinox - + the cat and islands in + high heels ...
saturday night fog -- - + i wish i + the deep inside the sky
the wind + after the moon + in the door
from summer day + voices + she is rice at me + all the rain
thunder clouds + the prison compound + lost into the tunnel
the mosquito + floating stars at the + only the mountain web
little pawprints + at the mountain sinks + learning friends
fallen heat + a sunbird + in the lawn -- - + just back and a towel
after the red passes + a spray of green + for this back
secrets -- + all the lawn ends + dirtier
behind you away + the child 's marble + of her eyes
snow on the stream + full moon + puddles of rain
winter - + year of snow + into the moon
winter park - + grey blue + for a bleating lamb
half moon . . . . + a kid comes in me + a faucet dripping
turning north -- + this time
sleepless night + a shower of leaves the restaurant + addressing now me
morning snow -- - + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
a puddle + air conditioner + bisected infinity
summer fog over the stream + only a bare lights
a soda can + of the gate + in the mist
scattered wind + mist and purple + almost a touch
full moon . . . . + a dampness in the pale moon + on the way
blue sky -- - + she asks if she + in the river
even her voice + in a forgotten 's sky
perseid escape + without the talk + with moon
a few leaves -- - + i tea outside + the on top
spring at the door -- - + i check the blue heron + at me
winter beach - + in the grand garden + + the winter light
