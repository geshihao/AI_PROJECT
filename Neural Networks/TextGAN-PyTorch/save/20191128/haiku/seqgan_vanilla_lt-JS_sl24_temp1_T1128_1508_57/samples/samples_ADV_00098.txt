a butterfly , + a yogi does + the real iris lost out of the terrorists
after a single leaf + a wish + grey sky
traveling + silence - and fall + old gold
first day of home + the house across the edge + over the fountain
fall morning - + outside the same back , + spring rain
my mom -- - + i another man looks at window + the road
cold moon - + a only love + in the family garden
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + last day
moon on -- - + a train runs + at the stream
mist to the pencil + the long old man + at the gate
the holy wine -- + saw i + white lilies stick out + in the fog
the old life + packed in her wallet + spring equinox
the blank words + a cold housing + + in the bedroom
summer march hand just i find + the after cedar gumbo + september fog
a slow pregnant daughter + for the lingering coat + as the world
late of a desk + + a little salt + in the train
the moon - + a woodpecker 's stream + soho rain
flies to rain - + she finally + in the tunnel
harvest moon . . . . + this mountain blossoms - + the sunset
the sound of snow . . . + the undercurrent + in the old woman
rainy day + the minty freshness + in grey hand
summer heat + the couple + all i koi
moonless night -- - + raindrops + in the clouds
crowded train ... + with the bottle pauses + in conversation
more lights - + our boys + shades of snow
snow turns over the way + with the incense stick love + over the incense shadow
fog over the branch + windshield wipers clear + the friend 's back again
after the moon + it in the moon + on the window
on lake -- - + the smell of blue a + first fireworks
a lake . . . . . . . . just one + back to reveal river + at the incense
winter rain- + flames dance + the trails cream
letting the branch go + the weather . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
