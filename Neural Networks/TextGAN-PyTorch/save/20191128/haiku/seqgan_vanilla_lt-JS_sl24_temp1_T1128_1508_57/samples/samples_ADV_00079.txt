the room ’ s end ... + the sharpness in his eyes + i is somewhere , + hospice church at the table
running itself + a tear of birds + on the mud : + sky
evening fog -- - + a yogi does + the prison compound + red
deep spring drizzle -- - + she has lost she doing candles + intrude into the wind
fog lifting + a mudspattered apache + sings in the loon
summer heat + the cat turns over the lights + of the lingering
muggy night - + the silence + at the wind
a pear home + a few dewdrops on + with rose
a small moon + all the yellow house + from the old gourd
the old woman + starts down + dim their garden
on stare + in the tea mug + snow
first day + by the silence + a caged nest after time .
summer 's end + all the end of thunder . . . + a carp + on the thoughts
winter day - + even the fewest details + again
winter rain + a rain carries in me + turns in the air , this summer wind
crescent moon - + the old violin , + summer wave
summer heat + my neighbor and ashes + into a garden
empty subway station -- + the cloud of the scent + of mussel shells
somewhere + just after here + a caged bird ...
summer 's end ... + long wish + the old stove + slow splits + rising
autumn equinox - + a bulbul 's wab + but i love back + into the moon
driving home + the moon ’ s + home
back at the wish— + far away its way + she 's way + in my old photo
above the cranes pond + with the world behind— + thoughts
leaf in the hurricane -- - + she has + her wedding vows
first day of autumn + even the soft moon + a wifi hotspot
the old town + the minty freshness + of clouds , + summer 's autumn
on lake gift + another thought + towards the shadow
cold moon - + a cobra escapes from + the curve of home
' i used to be + a daffodil left + in the paver
three men and stars + at the way me + stifling the pond
change in snow + the moon rises wearily + with the syringe
