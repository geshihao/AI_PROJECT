rain - + the widow tightens + each higher - + on the sea
falling leaves- + unpacking deep new out + in the paver
the spring moon -- + the sunshine around the wind + the cormorant ’ s door
thicker dust + on the snow outside + the silence
summer 's end— + what made me + from the bed 's child
autumn mist + the hand that donkey 's braying into + is a blood ’ s photo
melting snow - + a tear of embalming fluid runs + through the death wave
king with armour + a amish man looks at + half other dusk
somewhere + only the silence beyond the time looks + sunny back and back
summer sky . . . + a mixture of in the cremation + cicada buzz + a dozen roses
hazy skies + i 'll onions + downriver
after the fog + i have dreams + share a giant wave
eclipse + the lingering train + a still summer dust + on the end
the family gathered— + a blue heron at + ahead
the tall pines + slowly the bouquets ... + the baby grows + amongst grey
snacking on tracks + and shoe shine + and sunset
rabbit and rain - + a blonde + a whiff of home
teenagers + as leaves fall + by time
finally the koi rises + somewhere during its plane + in the garden
goodwill window sale + fluttering + and sea
a end forest 's rain- + with stars . . + the blind horse
bones on a flame + firecracker papers + wander the aroma + scent of rain
guid friday - + mother 's handwriting ... + is so other white
out of tea -- - + my neighbor in the window + a smoke wisp
into night -- - + she ties her bikini top + back story
winter drags end + at the end + out of a raindrop + scatter the wind
poppy pepper + only the cemetery + wind
candle snuffer -- + a gray sweater lifts . . . + on my world
winter beach - + only sip of a hurricane drips + last back back and warm
harvest moon ... + the moon 's smile + has + on the family book
partly cloudy— + i pass the cherry blossoms + spring sun
among the candelabra + of the stars and + a shot-out sea . . . . + a cup of snow
