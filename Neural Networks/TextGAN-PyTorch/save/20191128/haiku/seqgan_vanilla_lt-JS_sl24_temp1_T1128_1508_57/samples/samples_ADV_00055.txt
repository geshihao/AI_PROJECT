way back back , + we remember the office + open me
morphine drip + she passes me the wind + falling snow
a vase + nearly phonecall walks up + over date + life - + evening rain
summer sky -- - + the crunch leaf lights + around the moon
the empty nest + thoughts shaping and + red heels + the firework home
train whistle + nobody + a sun is lights + a daisy-chain
winter clouds + too pouring out of the red heat gathers + a bird shadow
freight poppies ... + a scent of red + summer 's dry skin
morning fog -- - + i 'm and a loon 's reply
no moon ... + another rose + turns up
valentine 's end + the quiet mother ’ s breath + melts a dragged christmas love + half moon
day moon - + the homeless man looks up + at the fuselage
after the river + a swollen tick + on the autumn
summer heat + the magpie passes winter + ... + ...
mid — + i talk of revelations + hand to grey
early morning fog + the barber is + all the family way + to a spider air
so day + the garden buddha + heavy chain
a long ripple out + the lipstick + is the goldenrod
rain for the sky and + again + in the world
scudding clouds + old in the moon
awake + thoughts on the tracks ... + i am
leaf in the dog + on the ground + a little more back
winter drizzle + cool cup of bubbles + a helmut of the bed
old friends . . . . . . . a half moon + on the family book
full moon . . . day with snow + all the mist
the wind + on the year , + the silence reaches in snow
a teacup + across the sound of a loon shatters + the night train
in the shade + of the bride + in grey shadow
summer heat + the cat turns and saw + old warriors
church in the sky -- - + i fish at the + cool breeze
undecided voter + half a blue heron at me + the morning light
summer heat + a long pause + in the snow
