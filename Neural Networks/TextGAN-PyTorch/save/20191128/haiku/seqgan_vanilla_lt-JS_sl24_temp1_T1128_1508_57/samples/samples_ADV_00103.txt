falling fog -- - + two boys are as the open
summer haze -- - + she has us + the groom 's shouthers
in the moon + the convict 's son + snow 's mist
summer heat + my shadow + thoughts seeds over
porch swing + warm blue fingers + the clean slate
snow and short life + a morning coffee cup + shifts
blue moon -- + i ticking light + she smiles
saturday winter end ... + the cotton ends + + across the past tense
above the moon + with the brewery passes november + the mountain notch
old love walks the man , . ... + ... seeds from the clover
the old man + stands on river + with light time
a butterfly , + the air conditioner lights , + touching the chimneys
a touch + of the fog and just + old memories
letting the branch come . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the pheasant passes ... +
wiping the fields to work + just the world + cold rain
late summer - + some one air conditioner + `` the family
at the day - + all stars ... + from the path
blue sky -- - + i i and and wind
the old day ... + the witch passes me + thoughts on
snow melt -- + the last whistle night + at the back light
east river wind - + through our praying face + in the old bed
winter chill + a garden fading + at dusk
nude beach + the crinkled edges + with a tulip
winter day + end ... + in the cheek
summer sky -- - + around the fog has + with snow 's old back
frosty wind + on the wind
autumn day -- - + a little boy watches + a dragged new moon
windy day -- - + a lizard on the + terrorists
after the cranes + the old life + ancient reflections
alone on the roofs -- - + she has + the pileated laundry cloud
the blank page bloom slowly + the long way + all the blue sky ...
waiting for the gate + the snail crawls the few notes higher
