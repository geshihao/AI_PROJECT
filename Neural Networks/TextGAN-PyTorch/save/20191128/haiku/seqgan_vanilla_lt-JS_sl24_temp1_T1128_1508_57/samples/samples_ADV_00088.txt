winter drags winter + at the wind + a boy woman is lost + autumn clouds
drought- + weeds sprouting + near the sprinkler
sunset falling darkness + the migrant speaks of her + at the street .
a street artist + soon grey day + turns back and mary + old acquaintances
the breeze + takes away his eyes ... + snow
rain - + she 's warmth + the newborn
the trainyard at day + first clear + raindrops on the + lighting bugs
cold moon - + a newborn colt tries to be + spring
rusty fence - + the old man runs + for a stranger
burning to work + a sweetness + a good moon
equinox - + a pregnant woman + sing 's warm
a break in the fog + only small to go + and dull light out
the light of + lingering morning . . . + a blue haiku
after the roofs -- - + she asks if she + in her underwear + by the white hairs
for moonlight + first snow falls + home
winter clouds - + turns snow and + fresh moonlight on the family
harvest moon -- + the river bank + moves the patio + soho rain
flu flute crash ... + too many seeds + alone
the curved cheek + a spray of + rose scented old path
summer heat + the photo of a sharp + grows those wake
the empty room - + scent of cinnamon + and a missing lost crescent moon
as the moon + fogging up the arms
summer heat + a couple of his hand , + heavy rain
retirement home - + a yellow cab + again
rainy dawn + the smell of the leaves + the old tulip
thousands of the end ... + a checkerspot in our pot + again
winter drags end ... + the garden + on the family book
autumn park + my shadow + linger
my husband complains again + fallen has + old to me
day moon - + the distance between us + outside
blue sky -- - + young walk the love + an unlocked door
half moon -- - + a steaming + white house
