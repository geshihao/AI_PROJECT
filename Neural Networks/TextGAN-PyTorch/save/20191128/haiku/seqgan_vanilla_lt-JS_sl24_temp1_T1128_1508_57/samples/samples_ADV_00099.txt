valentine 's day ... - + in the black umbrella . . deep fog
snow in the door + ... traffic and still + the river 's end a moon
back over the fog + lingering day + from a snowflake
leap year - + the coffee backs + of my back field
winter night + the barber is + the driver ’ s cry
the stare + of the hot list + time
a soda can + old woman has + the cement awning
the sound of steps of + early rain in the + north and over : + back into snow
summer heat -- - + she dunes ... + a haiku poet
red sky- + a smell of a kid + old pond
equinox - + the moon is + the pumpkin ’ + over the wake
winter fog -- - + i a blue sky— + the call on snow
spring breeze + the rabbit walks up + rising
rainy morning -- + a police kisses hand + breastfeeding her hair + in the mist
monday wind + the lingering day and + spring fog
foggy day -- - + the sun ray dances + the train laundry
urban geese - + the old life laid nodding + spring weeds
in a rose nightlight + old oak + checking me out out the mist + old brick wall
passing ice + the river 's path + the old gourd
deep deep nothing + blossoming over the train + old butterfly net
alighting + after mountain pass + stone angels
almost sky -- - + the old child + on owl shadow
my mother cries + on the last and tea + on the moon
a few woman + holding a breeze + a glass of garden
autumn snow + puddles at the window + over the incense shadow
grey day + a flirting couple + in the lake
grey day + running out of the sky + a deal for iphones
splat and a pub + unfolds and thrives - this year
grey day -- - + the first garden pots + i were
a soda can + drifts out + she in his own beat
washday gossip— + lost along the cooler + fog out
a dried lotus leaf + on of grey sea
