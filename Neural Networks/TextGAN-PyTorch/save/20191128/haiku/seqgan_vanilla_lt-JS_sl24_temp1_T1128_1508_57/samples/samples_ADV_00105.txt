a touch + twelve the wind , a loon shatters
snow on the stream + pale light + of the puppy
winter -- + a few tentative steps + the curtains
on the cow house fog + ... traffic lights . . . + a little more back
goodwill window + an old woman , + a house for a towel
the empty old + frogs and blackbirds + one red snow
a lake + feeling the midnight . . . + just one more gone
winter rain + a woman at snow
winter day - + after the car alarm + mother 's feet
how many wanderers + still crickets , + the breakfast practice up
first day of the wind + the moon + on a leash
the way old back + a wish + becoming
food channel + carried from the mist + in snow
rainy sky -- - + she asks me + tune the seats
a long stories + the ticking friend , + the cement awning
no longer a bright red + a sweet warmth flies are left
the empty nest + almost a cold coffee : + a turtle without eyes
a dull ache + i open the sun i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
first day of the snow + a beach beauty goes + over the incense
a soda can + becoming - + in the moon
the blood cloudless summer day -- - + the way she talks in + along the rose
winter wind + warmth of the last page + with spring
a vase + silence + of the fog
harvest moon . . . + i nothing in the train + is a slow to death
snow turns over the bed - + the last back used again
the debt ceiling will rise + moves in heavy time .
heavy rain + nothing across the fog -- - + blossoming butterfly
courtyard of my cry + on a flight of old + winter garden
sound of moonlight + a yogi pisses + in the pavement
daylight moon ... + a yogi does + the lake driver 's + in hand
ripened tomatoesâ€” + the empty bus - + the last blossoms
cloud drifts + the day 's eyes + old friends
