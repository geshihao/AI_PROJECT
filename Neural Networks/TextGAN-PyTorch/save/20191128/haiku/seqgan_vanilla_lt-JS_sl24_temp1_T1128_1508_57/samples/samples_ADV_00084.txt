in silence + one we remember + old plant-pot .
dead-end road + at the year breaks + the river of a house
rainy silence + a intake of the lie + thoughts
along the moon + the silence + in my ex-wife
winter wheat + crows 's birds + dancing cool from the page
deep fog + by the lipstick + in my cheek

a lake + purl reminder light + the scent of + red tea
