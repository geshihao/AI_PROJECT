a second glass of the uncle + a bottle gathers + for a stranger
rainy dawn + the river moon + the wall falling is + all dawn
summer heat + the photo of the way only + in the mist
garden stones + pearled by old + in fog and spring
a flurry of snow + at the door + a rose house + outside
you have a beach wall + she in the ink + through a early sky
a woman gathers + at the world + with the sunset
summer heat + the breeze carries + in the river ice -
where the rainfall + child - + with a ripe cherry
a bee chose + and the scent of approaching moon + on the family book
spring shower + reading staring out + in the river
deep fog ... + the finally washed + day moon
i day - + the silence + at a shoulders
typos + on first fish look at the winter + summer
spring mist + the cloud passes november + the mist
a soda can + drifts out + she smiles
the river wind blows too the + train is a tractor + in the loon 's fog
a walk + only because fog and mary + a still love geese
windswept garden pots + i watch the train + on time
winter morning + one + veils me on the sun + beyond the bed
a rainy sound + and sand spray + in the family garden
summer heat + cool hot hair + over the mature corn
in the old end ... + a pregnant tea + unknot
the whistle of the night + back to its echo of the + a pine cone
winter day - + without the crows + scent of rain
late summer - + a yogi pisses + in a snail 's + wears a lit candle
i long summer sun + the only slice + the whole christmas light
chemo drip + ... mile + is the autumn moon
vesta 's templum + love + somewhere during its grey sky
a long list gathers . . . a maw snuves + sings falling
midnight + i open fog + the moon
computer drone + as heavy wind
