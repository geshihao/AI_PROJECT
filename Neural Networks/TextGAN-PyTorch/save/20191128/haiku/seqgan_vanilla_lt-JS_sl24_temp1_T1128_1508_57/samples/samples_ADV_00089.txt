moon gazing + along the rainwashed eucalyptus + rising
the one for you . . . deep fog + a decade has more + relapse
a butterfly , broken + three stretches + at us
still pond -- + a tiny red house + turns in the moon + on a rest , deep dreaming
autumn wind + here and there + a sun ray ends + across the rest
the old daughter + comings and may earth + a buffalo
a black woman + of the end of the red high heels + all dinner
everything + she takes off me of the night + old shoes
a lake + carving + neighbor needs + in the fog
summer fog -- - + i leave the river + two conversations
after the fog + thoughts of one + turns inside me + a faucet dripping
moon on the forecast -- - + i tea with summer + old end the garden
snow flurries - + she takes off his + all dawn
rainy dawn -- - + she takes wearing a lamp on the wind + advents candles
break up + the song 's web + at twilight - + with her belly
the window veteran 's + crying grey window + the croaking of old pond
a young day + we go back + on the darkness
rainy day -- - + a pool at the window + autumn moon
first snow - + the phone cord + passing moon
fever wind + a cloud of the wind + on the wall
mid february + a homeless man gathers cans + urban memorial
winter drags . . . . + so many creases + in mother light
no spring rain - + the way out our love calls : + two whispers . . deep footprints
forgetting
after the rainstorm + talk + and then the mist
drunk tonight -- - + too many women + wear pants
cold wind and the + someone has us + on the river
a lake + underlying flowers + pale moon + on a flight
the stream man + hand in locked into + all my window
the way from the bed - + the sound of + with the world 's way + the warmth of garden
rainy night -- - + the sound of some one + back into me + over the green
summer heat - + a witch passes me + without a seed
