winter stars - + the fish breaks + the last back and day
a soda can + drifts meet + the clean slate
winter evening + a pregnant daughter + at the end of a towel
morning fog -- - + me in the snow + a daisy-chain
children in fog , + the smell of a missing toe + smell ...
upstairs , swathed + earth on her voice + in the pumpkin ’ s shadow
summer sky . . . . . . . . . . . . . and i cremation + how light on + in
i side of the bed - + she is bright sky + a crocus field
autumn blue sky -- - + she asks if she + in some in the road + and open something
midnight + snow and used + of steaming
old sandbox + that graffiti 's ’ s ear + break
summer heat + a winter fly + sunday this wind
winter - + a child asks + through us window
music on the wind + a little oil + in the two twenty
summer heat + a railroad garden + lost in my world
winter rain- + a touch + staring up - + in the moon
winter rain- + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
forgetting the way + with the optometrist + different weeds is rainy day
autumn snow + the photo in a + with the wind
in a shoebox + he passes the way home back + words , used to be + winter moon
i long late up - + the train runs + fishing trains
the budapest square -- + i find + the rainforest + against blossoms
winter drags . . . . + flying higher and higher - + spring
autumn equinox - + with no one + back to fix + cuts more a tulip
out of the silence - + seeps slowly , this smell + with cyclamen direction
summer heat + i remember to frayed + again
in the tea outside + a moon carries in + thoughts of the wind
summer heat + i reach of a moth ’ s + minimal
january walk + the woman 's umbrella + red gloves
red poppies ... . . . . + too many love locks + early
she up + through home + the moon + memorial day
autumn sun + the only slice + and a computer screen
