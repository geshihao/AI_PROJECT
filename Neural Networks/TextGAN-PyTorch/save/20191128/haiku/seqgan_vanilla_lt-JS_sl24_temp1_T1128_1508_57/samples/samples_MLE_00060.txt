cold saturday night -- + the crunch of a blue haiku + to snore
the convict 's pencil + between i left i left against the fireworks + swinging
thunderstorm + the morning train + all that way + in his umbrella .
ash wednesday + nice smell + to the back back
summer lilac . . . + how many women + you into the rain
old temple + starts blows away + all my coffee
morning fog + the king of hearts to take + how bittersweet + to butterflies
he looks perplexed - + more enough to work + the pictures of snowflakes
dawn -- - + another beach boys out + who reflections
winter air + the sharpness rose ; + a spoonful + leaves
an old temple + who breaks my underwear + for a star -- -
troubled sleep -- + a cloud of us + hospice laundry
lonely spring day -- + another scent + from last summer deepens
cold morning sea— + how what have i had touch + the long night
maple tree + everything + of steaming locks
distant thunder + —nighthawks fog + with sunspot by last fireworks + spring mist
yard snow - + i after heavy blue + carpet this loading dock
moonless may moon -- + this moonlight— + pompeii
catalog time + something of prairie + the nagasaki temple sky + next to scatter
grey night -- + the sound of + open book ; + fishing what sunrise
windless day + she tells me she 's + flies to remember + to gulp the shade
night silence + through find + september heat net
paddling slowly where again + a tremble + as that tears of a cherry rain
rainy baltimore + leaf light on the old shadow
deep into the moon + a lost we have sand ... + spring draws deeper
obsidian night + a red forest + blue bowl to dusk
calling + in the navel will left + behind the rain
sudden chill -- + layers of sand + for part of spring
a zen garden + he bus shelter + her guitar
rabbit trail + a constellation of prayer + in the disused mouth + aglow
coffee on december - + a wish + & she clutches a seed
three touch feels + shaking hours game + drinks at dusk memorial sound
