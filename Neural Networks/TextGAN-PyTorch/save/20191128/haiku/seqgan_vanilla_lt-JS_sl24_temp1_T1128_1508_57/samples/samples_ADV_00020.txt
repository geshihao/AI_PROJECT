a early a grey cranes + a building allowed + the world
a jar of pennies + on the shadow + grey sky
no each lights - + we talk of love locks + i wake + flowered once
november winds + melting workers + on the mountain notch
the highest come takes it - + the smell of a mist + craters
a break through i . . . + september blue blue + runs
dinner at the sky + a only picture + of us together

just back in the main stem + of the reserves + unknot
from the child drowned out -- - + i am
a railroad window + winter moon + on the lawn
last light night -- - + a flattened 's eyes + a still pond
country sudden clear + running out of the incense stick out + i wake grey
a jar of pennies + on the hands , a row + of a breeze
summer heat + the dragonfly lands + in the mist

equinox + the morning 's end + but i 'll undone
september eleven -- - + the cat pregnant blue + without up
summer heat + strands of that talk on the road + sunny light
my childhood -- under + two prison dog + a swan 's wife up up
sultry winds -- - + i remains of cooking -- + just watching
evening fog + a contrail ... + a dragonfly + autumn rain
