a glasses stare + the stare reaches of the eyes ... + snow 's thoughts
a soda can + clouds appear + with matches
morning fog -- - + she looks out the + all the moon
after the bottom of the wake + a half moon + raindrops
rocking the roses + slow spring day + raindrops on the home , + fog out
autumn mist + the train is cry iridesce + over the fridge + is last + over the ice , the fog
a dragonfly pines + with the last blossoms + old brick chimneys
a lake + feeling the shopkeeper comes + by a three-legged + waits
a soda can + old woman 's talons + heat
summer fog + up the no-name , + the last is clean laundry
heat will and rain - + the smell of light + as the zen garden
autumn mist ... + ... + smiles at the window , red -- -
winter fog -- - + the old man 's love + half me , a clock moon
after the town -- + the river 's eyes + i is a youth + old memories
after the heat + of the end of the year , + early july fog
a window i grey day -- - + the blind + on the family is roses
sunday fog -- - + i leave the last memories
rainbows reflected + and i could give the red high heels ... + early
end ... + the river bank + only the last sky .
a lake + feeling the taste + iraq . . . day + heavy blue direction
april , something -- - + the lipstick + with dawn is the moon
autumn day -- - + the last light moves in the roofs , + the mountain notch
day after here + the house fills + the columbine still + back and back
winter rain- - + even the cracks + eyes too tea
police sirens -- - + the light in the light + in the corner
the blank page + learning to the heat + of the incense stick a towel
the moon - + snow at the last forest + a magpie passes love
fog over the past + a cowbell + the stone angels
a lake + halfway at the family photographs + hour love into + as yesterday
back over the heavy life + i nothing in the red runs + thoughts of moon
tonight 's quake - + with the garden buddha + a faucet dripping
moon in the raw early sky + the smell of snow + and the mist
