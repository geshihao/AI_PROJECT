fog and ? + the snowman begins + by bark beetles
first spring storm -- - + my windows + of a hurry
hard of the rain + a lone woman has erased + all my snow
the day of night + his sleeping lights + as cradle her memories
evening moon + long in the new silence + he tunes + starvation 's flight up
collecting shells - + my watching haiku + from the mountain ’ s bottom of dawn
hunter 's pow-wow— + state crows noon ’ s door- + butterflies
sunrise -- - + i look at the road + to drive out fork was
spring mist + i watch the guy + comes in another road
how many thunder— + the hothouse line of my tongue + christmas leaves
then her ripple go + slowly cresting towards shore + a caged bird
city winter darkness + a leaves blown from me + in the snow
harvest moon -- + the metal-edged trail of around + we shall meet again
on now , sign , i righted + a windshield blows away + the low walnut
hoping the shadows at clothes + no one + left on the last page
falling leaves— + the bars also -she on the window + falling leaves
planetarium + my fingers + he looks at dusk
thousands of side of geese ends + fog shovels care + the still garbage truck is dry ring
novocain prick -- + chewing gum spots grey + she tracks in her nose + a half moon
after the cricket . . . + how much powdered sugar + winter solstice
sudden shower + cursing the tongue + of the cherry egg you going through the hairs
first mandarin + seeing dawn + the two islands in its grey hair + distant trail rose
october night + a glass parts + at shadow to the chair
empty ferris wheel -- + the winter moon + on the rest
blue sky -- + a flock of from you itself + field of jasmine
under cold rain + on the dogs , + a cigarette butt
thanksgiving leftovers -- - + my sleeping only turns water + petrol say + another contraction
oh , the day moon - + a decade has passed + mirror - + whatever moon
new butterfly . . + a tiny lizard + by her hymnal
slate skys + seeds sundogs
first pussy willows -- + sunshine together + through settle down + on the chill
running tar + the sun passes that is fish + through the sand dust
