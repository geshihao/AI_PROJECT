icicles melting + the last glimmering + of oystercatchers
running home + the last blossoms + on the summer love
morning fog -- - + behind the haiku is i + a teacup , separate book
where the dock , + the last out of snow is the old red : + to the river 's window
summer heat + a patch of fog + as away + into the back + is a candle
windy day -- - + as lean memories in hand ... + ...
washday gossip— + above the fingerprints + raindrops is over the autumn sky -- - + the drop of grey
cold moon - + the silence of the last time + the old temple
winter drags . . . + the blue sky— + the sweet running rose
a glasses stare + a hole in the branch + all the earth air .
logging road— + the shadow to be + with many fingers
a returning i . . . + the smell of blue light + the fridge
edge of the lawn + the summer day -- - + in the river bank
december fog over + the cold moon + even i walk
windy day -- - + as the madeleine just the green too + old . . . day the heat
powdering the fog , + the old memories + hidden in garbage shadow
first day of seaweed , + the scent of + first snow 's time + time
in the moon + the lake 's flight + is passed fog
sound of heavy sky + a white scent + umbrella + over cold moon
silent year + over summer in + back in the moon
rivulets of snow + the silence between the dead people + i watch the big bed
standing stock-still clock + the garden begins + are unfair
autumn equinox - + the old man moves the ice + in my breasts
equinox - + the silence + at the sea
summer sky -- - + she looks out + in the river ... + the window , red
side of the moon , i i love + into the hospital + + by day of heat
delta walk the sale + at the last blossoms + he looks at me + over the table
dark spring day -- - + i all the end of the old tears + early sky
a final date + clink in the cold day -- - + the station
falling fog + thoughts shaping and i + early the rain
june 's end— + the neighbor and ashes + along the river 's window
morning storm -- + at the last day , the last sky
