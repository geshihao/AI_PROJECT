sunset -- - + not a bee + by the campsite
crowded subway -- - + the old breath walks lilacs + in the hardware store
good friday -- + patches of and i ashes + the way colour
as i lace and stars , + she always house + from the ocean egg cooking
on my wake moon + just one took distant in the panzer + after the rain
indian night and flow + to the reeds + the twists and other + something extemporise
snowstorm + parade or cars + the insomnia
rush hour traffic + everything + shifts direction
lullaby of you + the pink skater spins + the daffodils nodding
surprise sneeze + a the echo of last time she doing now + a whisper falling leavesâ€” + is it 's bird
warm rain storm + the real glove + bluebirds meet
friday the town + october on a dead friend + somebody starts + the searing morning .
my day + chirps the island + the wall mice
last station + just after the gate + nothing but stone angels
way rain on a windshield + snow shovels painted + from the shopping cart
summer rain + the small woman has think + a daisy-chain
good friday -- + removing even the distance + pompeii
before dawn + the coming river bank + through the wind
daybreak + the patter her phone + flirts ice
a dragon + now that gold leaves cradle + the groom 's single
the click + of two downgraded + but not enough
he pinch of the distance + of a clear side of green
morning fog -- + the cat on my duvet
yellow walnut leaves + the cricket 's laughter + so cold champagne
the dow + the fading heron mid-lake + somehow smaller
the strands of old jeans + thunderstorms behind the river
a rainy morning + twenty balloon + about n't need batteries
loneliness ; + the scent of mint + much to silence
veterans ' crowd + crying old drop + of his saxophone
same cold + on the daughter 's kick + a midge
presidents ' cemetery + all the end of a cloud + pierced
lingering light + in the tenth speaks + to a park bench
