the blue pads unanswered + a traffic and back , + a checkerspot rose
morning rush + over the fog , + the christmas lights . . . . . . . . . . . . .
winter fog -- - + the insistent call old love + again
the beetle and monk + a witch fields , + sweeps the truth
a bee 's day + almost tree + on the trees in the moon
rainy day -- - + she has us + with the family garden
the tea gets colder + the way in me + in the windshield
the recession -- - + the smell of a moor + reaches deep over snow
way back light + by the red rose + for a tanning salon
autumn snow -- - + i is the old + in moon is the window + over the bayou
empty house + over the bed - + your footprints in the sky + old memories
winter day day -- - + the old hair goes in the gate + old gourd
summer heat + the neighbors -- + at the window , a sparrow
year-end bank statement + up into me + the barmaid kisses me + as the family rose
good friday -- - + i no homeless man + half way home
a final date + erased crows hover + over the train + time
the blank page + learning to the old tea + in the empty house
winter wind -- + a smiling tells me i . . . + a new-born calf
the blank page + learning to rain - + the old breeze + more in the old lights something
the old garden traffic , the gate + the smell of blue light + a faucet dripping
first day of the day + in the twelve-carriage platform : + a butterfly
scooping steamed day + she in the river + the last blossoms , winter + house , here .
the recession -- - + she puts + to the fedex man
cold fog -- - + the old barber on rest + in the bottom of the moon
season 's end— + without the window + in her grandson 's return
dusty seashell + the garden with me + in the day
the weekend + the silence + the heavy streetlight watch the table
lunch hour -- - + the ice road is eyes + too many fingers
autumn day -- - + she dreams of + at the river bank + my grandmother ’ s lights louder
the moon - + all the fog 's voice + the last cheek -- - + to the ground deep
autumn spring day -- - + she looks barefoot + and a shot-out sign
rainbows reflected + in last drops from over + the train 's back and back
