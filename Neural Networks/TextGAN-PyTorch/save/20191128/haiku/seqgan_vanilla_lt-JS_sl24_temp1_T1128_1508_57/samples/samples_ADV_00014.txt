christmas album + every air conditioner + grows of spring
a window frames + a flattened possom + in the lawn
after the way + to the heat hangs + back in burning out + reunion
first spring . . . + she asks for me + i reply to summer mail
pranayama— + the sunrise + in my gate
screen of his ashes + the cold moon
summer 's end - + new line of my beer + phone number and last .
summer heat + the dragonfly lands + in the sky
on bare swallows ! - + her pause on the sky + old rainy day
summer warm end - + why she still + her love closes
typhoon warning + a couple of train + a skunk 's warning
on lake gift + the woodpecker + announces spring
cutting snow in the same old + haiku with wet all + open me + in the subway
christmas carols + drowned play the moon + back and shoe boxes + with matches
first juice + a friend gives me + in the thatch
summer heat + a fallen leaf + sing into a towel
my wife + feeling the funeral off + with bad in + old rainy night
the age + i brush the river + names and passed + is a bee 's mist
among the mardi gras colors + out by the bride + in the rain
at the day - + scent of apples ... + free splits are drip
a winter moon + the three-legged + on his hand ...
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
surfing waves + a teakettle + eyes
new butterfly . . . + where she skin + the driver ’ s fingerprints
giant moon . . . + she tells me + before the sky
from the armoire , + last night fills in she curtains + + in her hips
november blossom -- + the warmth where the rise red ' + rising moon
the blank page bloom ... + petrol rainbows appear + on the petals up
wolf call + ... horses hauds up the in midnight -- - + scatter with the morning
year 's day -- - + my christmas lights + she clutches a doll
a break - + long before crows + one last blossoms
petals in the bridge + a math teacher re-explains how + large out the wind
