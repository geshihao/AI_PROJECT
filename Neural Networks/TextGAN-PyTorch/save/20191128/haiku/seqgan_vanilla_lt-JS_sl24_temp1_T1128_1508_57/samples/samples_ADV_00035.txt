a summer sun + warmth of the leaves curled + as tap + in wildflowers
eclipse + the old man + in the door
barbecue - + a quiet year , collecting + moves of the hospice
morning fog -- - + a faded passes their breath + the smell the end of the old dodge
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + running out of dry pens
morning tea + in the fog + with spring rain
harvest moon ... + a gull 's umbrella + lost in the last page on the wind + slow soaking rain
this winter darkness - + a shower of crows + blocked by over the garden
halloween pumpkin + a echo of her + drifting in the winter + in hand
shaking out + listening to rain
deep deep nothing + with the sun and melting + in a mosque
winter stars - + a mile moves the goldenrod + in a traffic door - fog
autumn snow -- - + a map with many + determining best to reveal + with a death
severe sunlight : + the barber appears + in the syringe
autumn woods - + the same clouds , + smell - + turns brightly

everything + we watch the train + heavy with snow .
this winter day - + with the dow + peeping back on
a touch + holds the way to tea + and out of

november blossom -- + all paintings tilted + slightly off center
a lake + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the sky
autumn clouds - + fallen candies + on the sow ’ s ear
an house back cheek -- + a long line of the gate + without rose
alabaster moon , + yellow windows + in her hands
a broken + at a beer truck + gleams days
summer rain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
a pond 's . . . . + all the yellow train + on bare mother
high-stepping , + i wish i go + july moonless light
crescent moon - + a newborn colt moves + algae in the shadow
