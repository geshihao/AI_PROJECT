sunday morning -- - + a half moon + on the way
autumn ’ s day + we finding my tongue + ... little higher
melting snow - + finally the watter + muckle breers
winter stars - + a few seeds flutter + to enter the tunnel
slipping in + she looks at me + in a blue harness
winter fog -- - + she tells me i + winter moon
trains approaching -- + she reads through me + thoughts on the rain
more rain -- + i head out + in the mist
silent summer + at the branch back , + the smell of a heron moves + as yesterday
summer ’ s son , + put the scent of lilacs + old time
december love - + the smell of wind + morning moon
after the cold + a shell in moon + a little garden garden
saturday farm snow -- - + the end of the mannequins ' + talk of a rest bone
after the river + cold moon + the whole truth
one plus over the pollution -- + a world is hand ...
i saw that finger , -- + a few tentative melting + on the lemonade tree + back up the rose
by the rose open + thoughts of the sky + blue flashing lights
falling fog + but full snow + reflects my tea cup
summer 's end - + cracks has as i open + old country road
a fox + has a blue moon appears + in the other
the blank page + learning to sunlight -- + deep two states at the tunnel
after the river + only the coffee cup + with butter and honey
winter drags on . . . . + a smoker + at dawn
back over the taste + of the door + a map with snow -- - + thoughts of snow
summer moon + puddles ... + rising
tea house + and a blue plate + kitchen jars
brightening sky + the garden at me + in the pond + to a door
lingering morning + a yellowed dial + into the eyes
spring spring day -- - + the last way the sand + smell of a drink
bitterly snow + the last child drops + with many fingers
after the party + but rising on + one more sky ?
the old train : -- + the sound of + some a bottle : + without
