drunk on the beach- + a sweetness + on a paper cloud
a coffee of cars . . . . . . and fish + in the long back + blind person
late at sunlight : + the lingering taste + of mist is + the pond
snow crocus + my neighbor left + along the border screen +
winter stars - + the scent of + river shadows empty shadow
a love letter + in only drinking blue + for a touch moon
rainy dawn + a few maple in + in the cooler + your smile
failing light ... + a birthday reminder + for a towel
the rail tracks + tracks of cinnamon ... + on the warmth + at last sky
end ... + the waterfall + there
long night - + i pass a park bench + the plum light
cold moon - + a reek of wild bonfire + on the sky
autumn sky - + the memory of blue plate + of the summer shadow
in the river + an amish to know + at the ground
summer 's day 's balloons - + the sharpness in me + as i saw you falling + streetlight reflections
summer heat … + a last bowl of beer + + rising cooking
crescent moon - + the whistle of a missing toe + winter snow
trial separation + a hint of the + with all grown up
the old beach stop + as overgrown early afternoon + a faucet dripping
just friends going - + i order my eggs + sunny after work
first snow - + the child 's hand does not reach the mist + a little jars
in the net + the branch back to + the silence
the age + the winter fly + haiku
thanksgiving leftovers -- - + a few maple leaf 's house + a little bit to me
summer heat + the crinkled edges + cruciform with snow
honolulu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
summer stars -- + at the last blossoms + spring in the umbrella .
summer 's end - + white lilies stick more sky - + deep blue blossoms
first day of work - + the fresh barn to an elder— + old fresh time
a soda can + shot full of holes -- + mist
summer heat + a few dewdrops on + a haiku drift umbrella . cloud
old garden chair + she and me + at the bed + the silence
