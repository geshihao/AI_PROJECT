the recession -- - + a yogi does + the pileated woodpecker + flings + dirtier on
morning fog -- - + the slow scent + of the old lights for dark
rainy sky -- - + i walk i remember + old deck chair
folding chair + the cat 's eyes
a lake + feeling the wish— + fog again
the best lies + i read our love + lost staring back back to + across the moon
all day -- - + i red heels + so me
summer in + mother earths man + at the toilet
a bee + the echo of sunrise + family star
after the night + only picture , hardly just + winter equinox
winter wind + warmth of the table + early home
the something crumbs . . . . . . . dried puke + at the river runs
winter rain- - + the quarter at me + i change the garden
past midnight + old wish + old smile
half moon - + the harvest moon +
the family gathered— + a half moon + on the family book
turning light + the rose bush
humid morning . . . i find + the moon passes the + lighting past tense
the mulberry -- + a echo of the + with remnants
zazen - + a carriage oil still crickets + thoughts
the family gathered— + a smell of light + as lean story
talk of the call + the wind-shifting warmth + of his book : + just back and day
the old town + the silence of the way the ancestors + of an old notch
dawn - + the crinkled edges + of the river 's shadow
with the day + the sun does not in the taste + in a starling 's hand
early morning fog - + the therapist has + the grace + snow
a wish grey sale + somewhere at the family shadow + time
half the end : . . . + i warm the lights + the cement awning
hot day - + the lingering scent + share the incense shadow
first day of the moon + the bright moon + has the morning wind
a butterfly , + the lipstick + in heavy a tulip
mosquito of a red winter + back as the old + until smell of light
