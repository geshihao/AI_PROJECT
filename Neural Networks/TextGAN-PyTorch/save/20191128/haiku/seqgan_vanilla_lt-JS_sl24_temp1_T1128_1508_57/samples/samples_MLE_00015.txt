october winding road + the open mother + usual + spell
fields of downpours + of the disco
checkerspot days + an old state ordinary seeing + rising sale
late night fog - + my mother dances + poverty
locking up - + just a weight + of thigh
a yellow storm , + the scent of fireflies + blossoming far
the bombing work + i park lifting + the chimney
science day + a slow break in a funeral + pier stillness
backfire— + spring daylight it escape + a road seeds
alabaster spring rain + my intake ... + and each tide
chilled hour of souls day + of a dragonfly -- - + white warmth
lunch moon -- - + the prison petals shelter
sunrise vigil + last enough + not pass the sea come + 8:16
sipping line through + two codfish + homeless corner off they memories
spring sun + not renovation + a skylark 's cry
longest night— + repeating umbrellas + on the rain
saturday afternoon fog -- - + a smell + of a lung rhyme
heavy rain -- + my world between + one egg n fumes
at half-mast + two pierced on the charcoal ends + its tenderness
a over his gaping notebook + goes our beard + wildflowers to heaven
cutting thunder too clothes + a broken shadows shines + by the deal in + on pebbles
a guardrail + of the fullness + beneath a blue heron circle
rivulets of rain + the flower parts + of see still settle + his ac cup of last old sky
first walk , come and monk ... + local shelf on the river + early petals
relentless lilac + the prolific star ! filled + carrots by
almost you , + a church and an white pollen + of more it 's thoughts
autumn thunder -- - + in my skin + a shelves line globe
sun again + a quayside stage the half the smart cards + i supporting the times
labor day + the dentist leaf + on her mating sky
blue embrace + the white flat , + from a breaks open + pictures of each say
icicles -- + the clap + scatter from my shoulders
november moon -- - + the boat on + echoes on the new pines
