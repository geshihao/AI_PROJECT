scent of rain - + no more + as we kiss
a final date -- + mingling their ashes + in the window
an old watering can + everything + dandelion
a butterfly looks you + a cotton fields + bisected infinity
far at window + the white man staring at me + in the window
a curve in the monsoon + smell of the therapist + in the park
half moon -- - + she tells me i take off + i walk alone
a plate of winds + ... + of a garbage cart
spring afternoon + end ... + in the kitchen table
snow in the forecast -- - + a single bud ’ s colors : + at me
the clattering + of a sea cup a book ... + a single magpie
winter solstice -- + the running graffiti + at red tea
tropical storm warning + a yellow smog that is lost three tears + a daisy-chain
october scent + enough moon + on the window
men picketing + a snail crawls the smile disappeared + for a loon
what passion you had , + the morning prayers + + a little haiku
drifting fog + after the old + of uncelebrated birthdays
seeds catalogue + in the monsoon + in the middle of my prayers + too
a police stream 's heat + dusty asks me i + new year 's coffee
the stare + of a text + spring fog
the family gathered— + a end of the rise + watching the train whistle + again
first things end— + long garden + are solar -- - + scatter with the end
storm -- - + a pencil + to scatter seeds
memory care day + with one fresh bare sky + this time
a blank farm + snatches of the old leaf + without butterflies
first raindrops + the cry of the wind + a red wave alone
out of the fog + we talk of the + a wifi hotspot
summer ’ s day + we go out + in the mist
back pond - + a red bridge lights + spring equinox
summer in + heavy snow shovels become + as buddha 's extra day
midwinter dusk - + sound of the book of + thoughts of rain is the moon
an old photo + slowly all the weight + with enough fog
