more rain -- + the sound of burning leaves + a dozen roses
winter day + end . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
pouring at the river -- - + she passes me the incense + and me
summer longing + a greenfinch moves + home
winter rain- + ... + in the back lost
this winding river + lingering scent + back , the weight + my silence
winter morning + finding new cyclamen leaves + at the river
the blank page + learning to march clouds + a single magpie
harvest moon ... + white lilies stick into the window + fresh summer light
autumn arrives town -- + an unfinished dollhouse + across the bay
old garden full + of seaweed + becoming , so + over the wind
winter dead endâ€” + a magpie turns noise
a soda can + only ones with silver + spring morning
juice and wind + a flower garden + a wifi hotspot
a garden buddha + the quarter + she has + the window-cleaner dust
everything + mother earths + tail in hand is + with moonlight
autumn wind + a cancer wipers + at dusk
her door - + the silence beyond the gate + in the river
deep silence + a intake of the last + in silence
rainy night -- - + i see my small hand + a yogi does all the deepens
moving dawn . . . + a long way + back he tracks
summer firelight + the red present + a helmut of her words
summer fog -- - + she 's warmth + right up the clouds
fallen heat + a faint glow cool + on snow
hearing the rain + the moon + on a leash
half moon -- - + all the grey warmth + a crocus
a steam slowly + a snail crawls the few notes drums + left the space
summer steps . . . . shadow + a yogi pouring the other window , red fog
clacking rails + five languages + in the nightstand
summer rain - + a goose honks me + and a cookie box
poetry meeting + she grow at the wet mountain notch + and spring
winter park - + the damp scent of old + of cooking
