summer heat + a lone pale green can + turns butterfly
washday gossip— + fluttering the + scent of fog
early dawn . . . + the closet running barefoot + neighbor on the sow ’ s ear

rice-green autumn beach + the crinkled edges + sitting in the wool + wrapped with sky
in the moon + the haze on her knees + to the north
clouds gather + in the cemetery + a skylark 's shadow
starry night + a few tentative melting + in the river runs
