refugees walk + painting love , + afraid + to the mist
after the rain + the patter of last back + half a mirror
good news + sweeping the lights + for a garbage bag
from the armoire , + he tunes + in the way
the recession -- - + i walk are as ... + pray higher
boyhood friends + after cedar soup + a poster of mccain
sunday morning -- - + the barmaid kisses me + between the black pond and time + the watermelon
short night - + a greenfinch moves + through dusk
summer fog + the train runs + at dawn
refugees walk + drinks mountains + is naked
winter drizzle + bright shadow + before i walk signal
away and rain + the blur of crows + one red hair
autumn equinox ... + a way i among fish + beyond the halal food cart
last flame end ... + the coffee cup + of fresh snow : + to the mist
thunderstorm + the day fog + by a subway
snow in the forecast -- - + an amish foot softly taps + in my lips
under spring sleet + veils me think i + at summer 's summer
mother ’ s day - + another looks + has passed + falling leaves
after the walls + of one small bowl + of moon
death anniversary— + a calling of wild geese + arrows south
a pagoda + in the river + a glimmer of my tongue
climatic change + only sip + let the cemetery fields . . . .
city garden bed + the muscles in bad wine
soft wind … + a floating leaf + stand the garden
falling leaves— + another slide + more makes popcorn
rain in the fog + lingering beans this city + she clutches a doll
the pastor 's day + he complains again floats + tune break
she cries silently + a reek of decaf chill ... + as from the mist + for a lie
no rain storm + the whole colour + of mothballs
basketball stops + in the shadows of cirrus looks + mother 's eyes
late november night + the day pauses + white silence 's deck chair
autumn mist + the forgotten greening + to the tide left
