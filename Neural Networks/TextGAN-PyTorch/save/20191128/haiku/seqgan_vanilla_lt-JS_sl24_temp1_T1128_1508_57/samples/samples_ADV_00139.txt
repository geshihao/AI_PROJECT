the old weekend + half the daffodils + the election
alabaster moon— + fog resting on snow + old tune
after the cloudburst + from the soft moon + the blackbird 's old back
the family gathered— + a plastic bags + takes stand the wind , + two apart
cold morning sea— + so many potholes + running snow ... + old back
lightning moon - + the fluttering light + in the moon
overnight snow + early morning in + over the incense , longer
way back home + the smell of the moon + in the family home
in the sunrise . . . . + the old half way + without more milk
autumn mist ... + thoughts shaping and + half the trees are
presidents rises day -- - + i a fox picks over the window , a loon 's call + day the
dusty seashell + the cat turns turns the shadow + turns and dreams -- - + the harvest moon
after the fog -- - + your tea from the window , the mountain air
on lake -- - + the spot of not goes in the ice + old tune out
the old line + the becoming roses : + red along the old words
the farmer , + planting corn under + the bed half a rest , this side , the dusk
the one day -- - + the last world is the + scent of light
autumn snow -- - + your last tune in the spent falling + as the fedex man
a lake + feeling the taste + iraq in the + mother
the age + the lipstick + in the hardware store
deep winter day + thoughts on the + summer 's cracked day
the old town -- + the warming string gathers + last time + the last blossoms
a silent fog + thoughts of the + scent of the bottom of the warmth
border crossing + the last lingering day + old to me
a lake -- + the cow ’ s red : + over the incense
a soda can + turns woman i left + not the old gourd
black friday -- - + the smell of light + as all the pumpkin + sniffs + looks light
a small moon - + the colours of + some garden pots
lying heart to the twelve-carriage platform + she 's shouthers
after the walls + of the fog + a glimmer of snow 's fog
in the old + lengthening 's eyes the last phrase + on the last back back back light
falling fog + to the blooming address + + last blossoms
