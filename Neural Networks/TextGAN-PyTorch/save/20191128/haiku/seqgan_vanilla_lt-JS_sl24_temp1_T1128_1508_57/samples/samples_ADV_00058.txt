distant hurricane - unpack + and stars . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
easter -- - + she asks me + at your hand
when celsius + and stars , + rainless clouds
rainy afternoon -- + a golden dot on her love + on the dawn
solar flare - + scent of water + and spring rain
a soft circles of a kid + bends the end of the house + sunset too
fever page + spring moon + ... the rose
summer evening + after the way the beach + on the garden
indian summer + ... + high definition
deep winter— + + a cowbell the moon + on the toilet bowl
winter fog -- - + a hot drop of + by light out
summer evening + summer 's warm + in the compartment + to the bath
day moon - + a little salt + in the roses
calling to + the fallen leaf 's end
winter day -- - + a birthday balloon + + taking the silence
late summer wind + spilling closed + the hint of the well
alongside the moon + a pencil her . . . shadow + a second cup
quitting time + a mantle of snow + on the path
in the ruins + at a mirror showing + the silence
she looks at + beside the calendar + the silence breaker
the river weather -- + a clarinet + until time
undecided voter + half a tear of a plate + of queensborough train
snowmelt . . . . a platform + serves to fix + is somewhere
blue sky . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
barbecue - + a witch passes me + thoughts
she by each thigh + cool in darkness + some passengers
season of mists . . . . ... + between the window screen + ?
wooden spring sleet + in the cup— + back voices
rain clouds + i leave the crows + of mist
middle of winter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
dawn + the moon + in bits lifting fog
morning fog -- - + i leave the last + scent of rain
