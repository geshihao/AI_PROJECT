out of the river + only the silence + the wind failed going around through
summer rain - + the old violin goes + to the mist
autumn equinox - + a flat finish + on rose is a lullaby
summer heat + i 'll read butterflies ... + early
migrating cranes + a taste + of a familiar song
after the rose + mount fuji in the plans + old
at the hotel + plugging in a address + left for a candle

unconcerned + with divorce rates + mating butterflies
lanternless night . . . . . . and a + of a rainbow
summer heat + the scars + of tea direction
the smell + earth moon carries + on his lights +
up the wind + the gleam of pleasure boats + myself and spring
summer heat -- + the watering can + in the mist
