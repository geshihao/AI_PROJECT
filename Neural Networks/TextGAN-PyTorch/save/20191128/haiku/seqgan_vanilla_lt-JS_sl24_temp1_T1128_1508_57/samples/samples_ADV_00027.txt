in the night . . . + even i put on the snow ... + a train
a white list singer + tells how bad open me + summer day
memories + at autumn fog + by tea
winter evening - + a dove 's hands + all rest . . . .
wooden sky - + she asks if i + reshaping
long desert -- + a few tentative steps + something swimming + citibank skyscraper + with memories
the tang of + silence on the moon + keep-locked with the wind
so cold - + hot walk + of a red train
summer sunset -- - + last year + in the puppy
the age + the fog on the way + algae grows . .
summer solstice -- - + she tells me on a bare shower + unknot
the crunch weather -- - + tree practices drums + in the empty house + heat
high home - + i pass a loon shatters + the pond
a soda can + drifts out + nothing with lit
washing the party + lingering hot tune out the warmth + for the mist
sudden gust + nest in snow + this mattress
a dry maple leaf + only wet things i + i remember parts + a smell of sake
a soda can + she brushes ¡t along + only the counter top
from rose leaves + the puddle in hand + is a drink
a path shorter now + the moon in the mountain ’ s + tracks keeps mist
sunday snow at the autumn ends + a long pause + of a thatch + in snow
turning north -- + sand from take out just + the moon
herding a steady spring again . . . + a butterfly on passing grey
the empty nest + even the bouquets ... + between the coffee cup + lipstick , jar of reach
daybreak - + umbrellas + diet
end ... + the silence + in a nursery rhyme
the blank page + learning to spring + and stars
summer sky -- - + i study the moss + in the car door
never in + by moonlight . . . + on the back umbrella light
half moon -- + a few tentative steps + ... so serious ... + a dragged essence
gaza at twilight… + lingering scent + of the end of walking silence
flute notes + fluttering + half the mist
