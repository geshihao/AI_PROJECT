on lake - + a homeless man 's calls + half-green , half-gold
rainy thunder and the incense + only some distant lightning + spring moon
at the doctor + a flattened possom + in the mist
winter drags . . . . + a snail crawls only smaller
a dull ache + i white peonies + in the window
afternoon fog -- - + the phone cord + back call on the
autumn melancholy + the rain gathers at + the neighbor 's not meet + i wake + this summer day
on bare swallows ! + immense the prison pine ... + on the tunnel
morphine drip + children flick marbles + in the mist
the snow + has the end + the usual sound + moon
a soda can + this cold moon + on the sky
summer longing + a yogi does i heard + old shoes
a lake + across of the moon + a snail 's shouthers + is half the mist
summer in + fog resting on snow + outside
winter drizzle + end of a homeless veteran 's + weathered ornaments
january warms up -- - + a red haired + in only reach
this sound + to crows roses + thoughts + in the mist
rainy day of the moon + a dog finds a bubble + filled with snow
a bullock cart + loaded high leaves + the girl in his green + silent dawn .
the moon - + a three-legged + on the barbed wire
between coffee + the mist gathers + the bar tender ran out + to coffee shop
the stare + of a blue heron + in his eyes
in the night ... + a puff of me + from the thatch
glint of december - + a quiet china , + a garbage truck + early sky
summer heat + the crinkled edges + of poppy petals
moon on the raw . lingering + in + she is only + at a subprime crisis
a soda can + and i a hand is wind
i sunday running home + the crumbs already + of a dogs
morning delivery + cool mountains + reaches up the deepens
summer heat + my place in the hornets + not blossoms
among the mardi gras colors + in the exercise yardâ€” + convicts shoot the breeze
autumn melancholy + the king of cedars + squeezing the sand + summer moon
