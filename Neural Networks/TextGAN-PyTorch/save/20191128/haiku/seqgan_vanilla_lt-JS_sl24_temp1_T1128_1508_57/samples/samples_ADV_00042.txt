the path of sky + a sun reaches the weight + a blue harness -- . + winter sunset
morning heat -- - + the smell of a snow + first light a house
how many wanderers + peachtree - winter + back into a hair
day 's day -- - + the winter stars + is a cigarette
a paper patch date + blossom too + the whole way back
summer house - + a patch of blue + back to then the tunnel
perseid showers + across the vase + has no butterflies ... + heat
half moon . . . . + back with bird-song + and 'sold '
a slow woman too early + the silence + of the moon
snow over the stream + only a phone alone + on the land
a soda can + free dreams + without me
short rain + a cricket at the snow + a red rose
summer heat + the changing in + the late summer 's reply
the blank friend + she asks if faces are heard + and the sky
a bullock cart + loaded high with shoe boxes + the driver â€™ s hand looks up + over the book
the light of the window + finally i could give her talk + into snow
drunk on the beach- + the long ash + at a raindrop moon
autumn snow + the milk takes flying higher and she finds + a half moon
summer fog + a few dewdrops on snow + your falling snow
summer heat + the little cat + & in the moon
he winds up - + the scent of + silence 's time
first snow + the smell of a moor + reaches across
blind date + talk on the weight + time
a hundred streets named + peachtree . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . all rainy
summer longing + a goose honks drinking up + at sweet garden
new moon . . . . ... + climbing without words + with the old gourd
stars falling + thoughts and snow + in the pond
autumn evening - + the cat walks into the breeze + winter moon
snow and short roses + a desk : + fluttering + in a bleating lamb
weathered wall- + over the way + of the bed + a fat persimmon
garden : + the muzzle of the codfish + looks moon
hurricane irene + in the semi-darkness + home + a new year 's route
