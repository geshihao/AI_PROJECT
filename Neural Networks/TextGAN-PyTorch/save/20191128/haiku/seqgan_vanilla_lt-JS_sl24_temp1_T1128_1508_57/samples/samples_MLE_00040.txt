a exit hanging pale moon + left in the border
the gap + when the nurse doing our breaths
first bright rose , + tints the new barber still + the bronx zoo
long lasting rain - + a baby drops a sunset + smell of autumn day
surfing when still + the winter sun has the pumpkin sack
taking time . . . + a wet grandchild 's darkness
slow trip + a faint road lights
afternoon tea + the gentle drone of tissue + others die
winter solstice -- - + the papaya red drops wind + spring nude
leap of newsprint + childhood too a darkening + our still arrives +
east shadows with snow . . . + almost so much powdery snow + tickled my braid
the old lady called mary + everyone on a mackerel + lock of fireflies
jizo festival + onto replace + the grace + of the tea cup
young lovers + the lengthening , the dim + busy yellow train
on the cabin + riding the canada geese - + all the mountains
on the swallows + distant in the one + sowing dreams
church steps in invisible + custom combiners harvest + has watch the emptiness
stopping + the white dead looks for + he asks me
autumn fireworks + wind blows away still + a house grows brighter
my daily bread + magnolia-tree appears + in the window
bulbul blues -- + the empty bird shadow + whatever + from this one
drinking mulled wine + at the roman aqueduct + nailed to yellow empty
house in the taste + of the best heart track + surprised by wind
summer reading + the spider 's dream + a yellow whistle of trees
stubbled fieldsâ€” + wet in the touch feels + no path
near the purpose . . . + she sees her wedding skin + autumn mist
valentines - + with a moth ornaments + sunset
late summer - + your finding two smoke + evening fog
from the path + nightfall -- - + his silences
november dusk -- + three replace her + bush promises
cold cold snap -- - + my daughter + he hid 25 earth
blood-red earth + a new birds appears + in the border town
