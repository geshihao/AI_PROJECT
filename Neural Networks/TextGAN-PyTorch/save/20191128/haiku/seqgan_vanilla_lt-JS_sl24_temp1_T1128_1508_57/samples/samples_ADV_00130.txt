rainy night -- - + she looks out + in the river 's window
a passengers cicadas + mother earths + goes home
after the cloudburst + waiting to meet the fog + of the halal food cart
call the old man + the sound of + river the old memories
first night -- - + she looks into the + lighting of the book together + old bitter
the recession -- - + the world , that graffiti is + fishing boats
in the ruins + in the empty motel + old butterfly
a soda can + us , the scent of burning a old eyes
friday the end -- + the last time + the old man looks in + a love for a tulip
a passengers waves + a yogi does + the last is trees in the moon
dusty seashell + the last day 's last blossoms + brush the snow
winter day - + the lipstick + is the sidewalk
hell -- - + the way the book + thoughts of window
a lake + far far away waits in the reserves + just back and day
a sausage chair + scent of the end + the moon passes ... + over the moon
the old back + tree outside the the coat + as sleeps in the wool and trees
headlights + in the stars , the forest + old memories
train running . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
a touch + the sudden chill : + in the sky
the cat shifts + you drifts drifts + the rose
the the tenderness + of the funeral river + shades of garden
first day of work + the desire of the haiku + goes on the heat .
a love for fall of the branch - + a flattened possom + from the mannequins is + in the way
circle against dark bed + the christmas love + at the cleaners
winter day day -- - + the old man 's voice + across the way
way back back , + the silence beyond the loon shatters
the old coat + over the world + in the sparrows
teeth in the fog -- - + as those nude apples + a sparks and page
the snow finds dreams + of the moon + on the last sky
a second glass of the uncle + the last man 's whole truth
winter day day -- - + the last tin oak shadow + turns over the + fog horns
window pane - + dreams blue with + as another + without shepherd
