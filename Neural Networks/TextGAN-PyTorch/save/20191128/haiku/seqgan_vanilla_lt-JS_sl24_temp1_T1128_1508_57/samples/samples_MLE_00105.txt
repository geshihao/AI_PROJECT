shaving + what might have been + having deep
winter drags on . . . + the railroad house + on the moon
the old temple + high heels ... + a yellow cab
thunderstorm + a single magpie runs indoors
winter solstice + the steady drone + behind the thatch
still pond -- + just i could give you it
easter dusk - + a gm chimney + is shadow + rice
snowmelt . . . + as the wind
morning haze -- - + the dog passes ... + a dollar bill first time
no black umbrella . . . + there walk + in the window
home alone -- + the dog finds all + the graffiti looks up + for a garbage code
severe frost - + the middle of the scent + of cooking
winter solstice + the forgotten 's pale stronger + looking up the in grey
open window -- + a photo of way geese + in the room
obituary + next to the ocean + waning moon
the dragon + sunning
september my son 's 18th birthday -- + not contained by a busy green + this tide-line of dawn .
saturday night morning -- - + our echoes rain + in the car door
winter morning + at something + of a lit on night
fall afternoon + just was to the autumn morning + a faucet dripping
half asleep - + i remember parts + of the path
endless rain + the child drowned + dig a homeless boat
day moon - + another slide + for the ocean moon
loneliness ; + the pony takes might love + wait and sunshine
tonight 's quake - + a flock of sweat + in day moon
fighting + the silence beyond the table
after her phonecall + following fog
moonless night- + on the light + from a clothesline
to the finland ; + a sound of the reserves + share a lost family
hail dead to simmer + a gap in the train air + on their owners chat
sleety trees + the crocus field + once melt
silence + the yard to pluck . . . + on the train
