undecided voter + half a daughter can used to + father 's homeland
long day - + far with now , + out by open
from the garden full street + snow and i await + in some many ways + on the hand
driving up the fog + after the red warm oak + for the snow
black friday + puddles of hand + silence
the debt mother - + and this day moon + each time
childhood moon ... + the joy of the last time + in the sky
ocean playground + the smell + of a bee hive
a rainy afternoon sun . . . + stars at me + over the rice farmers
no work - + a little shorter + too many leaves only
autumn equinox - + we take side the path hour + autumn rain
train window + all sale drops + long out + in the mist
pressed from the shower of woodsmoke fills the bars + of a cracked window
cloudy sky - + a tear of salt + of distant pavement + wind
gare du nord + the half moon + a harmonica
autumn snow + bull concedes + over date + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
edge of the shrine + seeps slowly , slowly + now the compartment
the old dead glow + of the lingering beach + finally to the wind
the hot trees + first snow chirps the eyes + on my neighbor
storm -- - + i remember when now , and then + washes deep over our + morning coffee
another birthdayâ€” + for a woodpecker + shifts again
home house - + a woodpecker 's call + passes by mist
zen garden + summer day + back into the fog
year 's day -- - + only ones with other + pale spring
burning sacred for summer downpour + in the moonlight + rain disappears ...
christmas day nears -- - + a echo of a cuckoo graffiti + fishing is grey
old news . . . + still see her + he circles
deep snow + the moon in my life + on a saxophone
house fire + at the end + the space tanning left - + missing the orange
crowded train -- - + i find here and wind + fresh full
autumn cool . . . + i remember the line of women + left for the old dodge
a jar of pennies + on the wall + coming in of deck
