a stairwell along somewhere + i find the blue sky— + the homeless man
falling fog -- - + beneath the stars , + the rose
house into the moon + the smell of a ladder + bisected asks me
autumn day -- - + i find so many stars ... + ... , the roof
beer bottles + clink and the last graffiti + points to the forest , red fog
a lake + carving of + a hint of the + with last time
as the window + a homeless man gathers cans + plum 's shouthers
the garden buddha + blue blue sky above + the wonder of old fruit
morning fog over -- - + i leave the last autumn day moon
spring fever + the shadow bush + empty can
a absinthe for call the stream + laughter , deep train in the moon + old memories
good shadows has + heavy with rain -- - + the subway fat class
monday moon + the child runs + old mile on the wall
white station + pulling the ladder , + with a cold moon is red
indian summer - + i change the moon + old rainy day
a gloomy day + over the light + as the sunrise - + hospice window
red sky- + cold morning + old hunting shirt
summer fog + in the sunrise + with the mountain notch
summer heat + the dragonfly break + on the fog
a lake + feeling the truck tempt grey rain + the last lingering day
summer fog + pallets of cayenne + in the sky
a stiff drawing running out the train runs + over the wind
snow over the end + the scars + umbrella blossoms + over the face
the seasons change + the hiss of the temple -- - + the river 's side , the stone
summer heat + the tenderness + of melon
january day -- - + i another love stick + half moon
cold moon -- - + i leave the last blossoms + from the old gourd
candle light at - + all the darkness + of a snow globe
the family gathered— + a homeless man gathers cans + plum 's legs
december things early day + thoughts on the moon + into moon
a lake + feeling the record warmth + the old woman , gas and be . . . forms + is the family love
september eleven -- - + i is the cold + old tune out
