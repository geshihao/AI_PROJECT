summer heat + a few dewdrops on + last night 's a bird
back home + the shape of love pot + oak shadow
in the rain + the lingering mist + in the mist
dead of summer + back away the mail air + a cigarette butt
evening fog + a lingering scent + of the pond

soft garden clouds + a yogi does + the church on the + perfect more + hat
sudden snow + a patch of fog + she finally swats the dark
after an old + learning to pronounce + - + the ac all machines

a float plane + divides the branch me + in the corner
summer heat + the crinkled edges + between gorse grey + + hospice window
unconcerned + with mom , + sunset
pissing mountain 's cry + go at a fish + with dawn
summer heat + starts with bird-song + sprouting - + this bark
moon-paved road + a few crows among + in the darkness
carousel -- + a farmer only + a skunk 's warning
morning fog -- - + she 's warmth + overgrown with bayou
spring clouds + at the stare + all the wind
old pond + spring day + mother 's whole over grey
a pear moon ... + the cat turns at the space + long abandonned
spring morning + finding my can + of the wind
this morning after balconies + again + of a blue sky
