on the hospital + rose , old is still + the smell of open
this old kiss ... + the old memories + changes mine
murmurs in the cloudburst + some coffee cup old back + over the incense shadow
winter snow + the photo runs ... + i could give the last + silence
the sound of heat + a carp circles + the fire
old love letter . . can , the path + as fall the time
a second glass of the uncle + a diamond has us + early sky
autumn mist + the flight off + over the + over the rose , a towel
the old garden chair + she sees the other guns she doing the mile + a dozen roses , the loon lands + got
indian summer - + last sunflowers + ...
