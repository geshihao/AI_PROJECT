unkind words + the silence + the blind each other hairs
silent edge + two friend + the western moon
summer day + back in the sound + with the sidewalk
alabaster moon , + with a blue haiku + as the shoes
the rose sky + the garden together + and the bug a moonless enough
the debt ceiling will snow carries + on heavy a fruit
on my smartphone + mount fuji in the mist + old deck chair
valentine 's day , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the farmer , + planting corn home + the haiku
anti-war demo + bursts at the bottom of the plans + house into the tunnel
the age + the bent backs + of old back
end ... + the silence + a poppies of find - + scatter the dark
the family gathered— old + in the faces are + the damp earth past curtains + over the + time
deep fog + the moon runs + lost at the bed
autumn equinox - + the old love + checking me
tempest 's day -- - + not the grey love + over stone angels
summer heat + the magpie turns here
moon gazing + the sweetness + old acquaintances
fresh snow + the fluttering of green heat + slow i . . day
break up the fog , a red branch back , + the old temple + just into the sky
heartwood + the smell of blue a house + first silence
first day of autumn - + the half moon + not out the sound
the old path + old oak + stands on window + old garage stream
the wind of day + a swollen tick + looks up the tunnel
grey sea over + spring clouds . . . + the forest 's path + time
first day of the moon , + blue with stars , the man 's way + the mountain notch
downpour - + the eye our love + late the light
the numbness + of unfinished + among weeds over the old dodge
the carpet incense + outside a train window + a is wall
winter drizzle + all the map i find + i share a snowflake
autumn mist + the carriage echo + with all dawn
first day of seaweed + soft day + the child ’ s time + old side at the bottle
