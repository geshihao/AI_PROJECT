after the cemetery + somewhere see of the leaves + lighting a stain + misty over
tang of salt spray + through smoke 's window
bitter wine -- + a bright thin + bay fills the dark 's
after midnight . . . + no one + unexpected rain
white roads + leading each lights + i want to see the last air
full moon— + drifts of desert + a winter coat hue
i brush + with the last road jar + among the streets
my sweaty skin -- + finding that first cow + needle in onto smile
scooping steamed pink + grey warmth + a library
spring equinox - + a student drawing + the bronx zoo
memorial day -- - . + the candle passes by + snow tastes the
fallen moon + my wife house he comes grey trees + on the bay .
will `` nightfall + the scent of their book of + with the thatch
cold wind + some the stairwell - + next for the garden ice
morning storm— + the smell of my tracks + a new shoots dices late
clicking through + seeing she tracks of her bra -- + the dawn ray net
first pussy willow + a japanese beetle i left i . . . + her grandchild
japanese quake + afternoon leaves flutter + in the hot tin red
labor day- + too moth 's + tales of steam
avalanche warning- + she sees of the begging monk + the hidden seems cleaner
hoping the moon + the small blue plate + the bookstore window
sharp day of the train -- + the tumult of each sip + of a bee 's
grey surrounds + going out it rains petals + crescent moon
spring fever + who kissed down + and one air
falling leaves- + unpacking homeless man comes + above the bay .
frozen pond -- + i even changes + train passes through
wildflowers + as etched names ... + a cloud
abandoned market + wallpaper fording + fog
tonight 's quake - + someone blossoms in my breasts + in his oranges bowl
wildflowers silence + just one behind she & + the news
independence day— + passing sparks + the fence
far from wall street + a flirting whistle + + in conversation
