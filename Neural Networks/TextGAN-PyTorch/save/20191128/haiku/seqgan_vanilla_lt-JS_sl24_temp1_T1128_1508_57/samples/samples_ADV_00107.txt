summer heat + a garden bush says the tracks
spring dreaming + a little boy watches + the toilet bed
refugees walk + painting over the sun + a wifi hotspot
sad news + the bar tender ran out of around + thoughts the garden
summer sky . . . + a wildflowers + mother sky
a lake + feeling the taste + of the door
a flurry of stars , the old + rise light at the + with lipstick + till the world
the rail tracks + toward the oranges bowl
divorce beneath + the sound of the red sky- + the soft moon
home at autumn ! + heavy with + across the distant garden + are white hairs
winter drags over . . . . + this mountain ridge + heat wave
young lovers + a long pause + back to candles + furrowing the family
ripened tomatoes— + the sound of the scent + of conversation
her cup -- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the rail tracks + the damp scent of clean clothes + a little salt + in old coffee
winter park - + the woodpecker 's pumpkin . . . . . . . . . . deep deep gone
the name + behind i remember + snow
brewing storm ... + two passengers than love + plum turns home
hot i love + rain in the moon + in the river
late at night— + the silence between the ways + of the mist
mothers ' day + a grace + snow 's back
autumn day -- - + the old woman , gas runs + and summer heat
winter - + some passengers , + the pond
autumn chill - + the smell of a end + the world of action verbs
the rill 's eleventh birthday - + pines air + with time
just before the moon - + the last of a red high + across heavy snow
a bee chose + this morning fog at me + in the river
the old woman , + a couple top by a mirror + a clean slate
cold fog -- - + she has + the homeless man 's over
old frog + over the bed + the haiku poet 's + gleams brightly grey
deep summer + the silence of a white time + old child
under the fog + just out the barn : + snow
