open window + the landscape coming + to the cooling tower + sunrise
morning rain + the heavy weight + in my neighbor 's wall
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + one a line
his old garden + on the branch + into the quarter + & through
dawn + a small crack out + the traffic sounds + from the tree
morning mist + my neighbour asks + on the hot air
how black ! + dirt on the last patch + of snow
autumn mist + the silence + our breaths out + the traffic sounds + from the dandelion
another birthday— + watching the long ash + on the incense
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than the photograph
waiting for + a light in the basement + in the open doorway + nothing but darkness
dew + lifting + in the wind + the scent of rain + orchard fog
spring mist + the first scent + of winter rain
frozen pond— + white antlers rise + through the ice . . . + a white rose + and leaves
exposed roots + the tree i + into the scent + of rain
street + a faint scent + of a long learning curve + a helmut of white hair
darkening trees + the steady shrilling + of cicadas + in the sky
spring mist + the sun in the wind + the morning sun + after the shower
the dance + on the walls traces + but the dandelion + smell of rain
the courtship -- + the monologue + of blue tree
overcast + until a white moth + traffic noise + through the gate to the day
valentine 's day + in the morning sky + on the river rain
humid morning + a bee floats + in my alley
the plane + behind the fridge + starts singing + a hot morning -- -
last day + a wet maple leaf sticks + to the mattress
first spring + outside the embassy + plaque polishing + without shepherd + autumn rain
waves + slowly cresting towards shore + a faint moon + over the clouds
sunset -- + the house fills + a little + she 'll i lost + her path
corn field + fallen candies + on the sidewalk cafe + half moon
i saw that finger + raised in greeting + the church lantern + summer 's end
spring breeze + she tucks the sonogram photo + from the son 's twelfth + in the tea cup
husband slowly + on the branch + the spring in the spring + autumn evening
