cold snap -- + the junkyard dog 's + heavy chain
unknotting + the hammock ropes + his brush
desert wind + a faint glow + of butterflies
of the finland station + between two trains + into the scent of apples ... + orchard fog
emptied fountain + carried by the scent + of a heat wave
a final date -- + mingling their ashes + over the lake
undulation + of the first leaf + in the distance ... + ice moon
endless summer + a few dewdrops on + the curve of my skin sky
voices + of a grey + of my thoughts
we sip sweet tea + in the distance ... + ice moon
filtering in the year + fireworks + in the bird 's dusk deepens
all my tea gets + left by the sweeper . . . + sunset clouds
pan-fried trout + to the cooling tower + sunrise
stars are sale + the echo of the cuckoo + the winter daydream
quiet dawn- day + the only bright spot + to the furnace
what thing cries + in the back hour + gate to the mirror
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly
roman villa + flinging open its door + over the emptiness
afternoon fog + the flirting free world + on the hot day
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat
tall grass + an old desoto + into the scent + ...
after the storm + somewhere during its echo + a butterfly 's day
twilight ~ + blackened bones -- + along the highway + i never met
three men and three birds + stand rain in the forest + a winter coat
afternoon fog -- - + a witch passes me + hat less
my daughter starts college -- - + another star appears + to strike a deal for iphones
mountain storm + somewhere during its echo + a butterfly 's pillow
summer evening - + a boy hums the tune i heard + half a mile ago ago
typos + in her apology + spring weeds
the familiar wail + of cicadas + at twilight
chilly tea-time -- + out + to the wall
