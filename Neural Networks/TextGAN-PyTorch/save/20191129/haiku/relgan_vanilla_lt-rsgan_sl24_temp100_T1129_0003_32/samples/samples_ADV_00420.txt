a sudden rain + the moon breaks + through the sky
first buds + of the rain + a rain + to the sky
half moon + halfway through the book open + in the distance + smell by rain
the underside + of lawnmowers + a wait 's last + a rose
butterfly shadows … + the moth ’ s + at one
concert under the + the silence + our breaths out + the traffic sounds + yellow snow
my tea gets + left by the lawn + trees without leaves + at the end of the world
just friends — + the moon + on the rose bed + a wait on the call
not in the + steppingstone ends off + i make + autumn rain
the underside + of lawnmowers + the last of the morning + from the last night
spring + a few blocks closer + on the wings + to wall street
mountain road + a hawk 's reflection glides + across the puddle
poetry books + banished + on the pine
spring + the tree i + street ' + the spring morning + feast
one by one + fireflies escape + the convict 's pencil + hard rain
nude beach + about size + and sighs
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the night + a day moon
blue dawn + the silence + of the night + new year 's day + a white butterfly
indian summer + the sweeping + the with sale + the world + of the spider web
spring mist + the sun in the wind + the sun in the dark + in the sky
a flagpole stands guard + in the old barn + end of the wind wears + the rose
new year + fireworks + the dog 's + rain begins
autumn mist + my neighbour sunday + through the fog + as i wish
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
first snow + the landscape + a winter moon + and says , `` bird '' + winter rain
new year + the calicantus morning + with a text + april rain
night after + the autumn morning + an apple ant + the river man
her 18th birthday— + the silence + on the road
my father + a her twins + a lost in the clouds + new address
a line + the morning sun + a hot morning -- + the end of my street + half price
morning + the murmur of the ocean + the sweet scent + of rain
green rimmed eye + in the sky + a in the bare + flutters in the breeze
