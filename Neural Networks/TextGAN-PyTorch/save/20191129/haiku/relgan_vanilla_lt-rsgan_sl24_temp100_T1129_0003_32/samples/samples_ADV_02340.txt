as i pass a + just one more down it + autumn evening
sudden hail + the with of the day + climbing onto
today again + snow in the river + a day moon
another button + lost along the way + lifting fog
sudden rain + puddles fill falling + just one by your back , + summer 's morning 's morning
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
blistering heat + a faint breeze moves + mountains
new coolness -- + a few tentative steps + on the rose bed
dentist 's office -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + deepens to the sunlight
early spring + everything + dripping
waning moon + the cricket behind her nails + to be seen . .
endless rain + christmas only + in the night 's face
lingering tide + on the empty + broken promises + summer 's end
january walk + santa claus and fog + a hot cup
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + outside with serpents
dusting the books + with no one geese + penetrates the thicket
chilly tea-time -- + an empty + sunshine or – + a flock of stars
porch swing + now and then + in the prison different radios
here and there + breaking through the dusk 's mist + on the window
afternoon -- - + i order my eggs + sunny day
abandoned farmhouse + a yellowed grocery list taped + to the dark time
early spring + everything + dripping
emptied fountain + carried by the autumn wind + silt scent
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
her morning + with the moon + the last ball of cheese + in the fridge
finally in the early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror
blue in the dream + the tea leaves -- - + a poster of my blouse
in the hospice + on the branch mouth + spring rain
memorial day - + he only wants to learn + to fly straight
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
the shells + nothing but ears + above the snow
beer bottles + clink to cooler + ice
