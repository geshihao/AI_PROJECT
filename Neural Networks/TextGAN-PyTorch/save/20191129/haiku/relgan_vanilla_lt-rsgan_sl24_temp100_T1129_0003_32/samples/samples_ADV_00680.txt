valentine 's day + that rain + on the christmas ornaments
on the cobb— + my husband complains again + full of her hair + on the blue iris
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + toward a blood moon
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder ! + field of stars
between morning chores + the crows chatter muffled + by my day 's snow
over monday spring + on the branch + still the morning + sunshine the night
pint + of the distance + with a dead blue cup + white laundry
where do + the darkness + an last drops
snowstorm— + her morning + still at weeds + through the mist -- + the milky way
spring mist + the silence + our breaths out + in teaspoons story
early spring + the minty freshness + of his death + still uncarved
after harsh words + the night adds shadows + in the empty house
festive season + the open mouth + of the rain
spring mist + the tree i + attention span
country cemetery + snail on corroded tombstone + trails from a to o ... + a yellow morning + over the clouds
deep + a lizard on her voice + after the shower + a yellow rose
back to school + the morning + without a her + graffiti
spring mist + the silence + our breaths out + in the mist
november 's mother + the sand on a cold + in the blue sky
spring mist + the tree i take + into the scent + of rain
last station + the king + of a harvest moon + ... horses browse + from the sparrow
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
looking at + under the floating + down the church + the spring in the mountain
the furniture + all the roof + a little + a winter rain
humid morning + ant traffic + at the mist -- + a shells in the clouds + new address
hot september -- + koi swim + on the salt day
this road + no more + into the scent + of rain
all souls day + the autumn morning + of such purpose . . the rice + graffiti
forgetting + the smell + of a hot rain + an apple
memorial day -- + in the corner of her + in the sky
grey today + the waves rush + memories
fallen + the fog makes the lights + rain out of reach
