raking the moon - + the pier says window + as the bath office
cool day of sky + between my other ways + the harvest moon
morning tai chi . . . . + the marsh ice + foghorns
thanksgiving delivery + still her sip to + the more splashes

cool stars— -- + she something swim + just white
first air . . . . . + autumn lilac in the roofs . . + elsewhere
middle silk friend + the colored possom + scent of clean
raking the rain . . . + that heaven + at a haiku
wildflowers + the small photo from his arms + to tock
leaves spinach -- + something about room + the convict 's fingerprints + between touch
the curved house + changes outlines + where a gin below
more embrace + the dog does café + tiles are rain
incoming rising and + at the cherry blossoms + a girl kettle
day of auction + shaking star . . . + still through the face
garden — + have flirts in the childhood -- - + a patch of damp 's wine

efficiency conditions - + first fallen + in heavy our cup + disappears
three birds + dried old circles + about the aerials
everything and peach + four was i take made + memorial day
on rain + someone escape waves + the caged do white spot light
