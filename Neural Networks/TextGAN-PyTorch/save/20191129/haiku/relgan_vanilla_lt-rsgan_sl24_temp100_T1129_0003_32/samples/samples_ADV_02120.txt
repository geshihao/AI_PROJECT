deux cygnes + remembering you + on the fallen pears
as old as i feel + on my voice dissipates + one by the roses
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
stars at dusk + to the sheperds eyes + a single bud on garden grey + aimlessly
rush hour + our echoes meet + in the stairwell
distant temple drums + close between the sound of a + pounding summer
in the hospice + on the rainwashed + lighting the same + winter solstice
freeze warning -- + the i drip burning + on my be dust
under a sky -- - + a line of ants + i sip my buy + his old
gone + new day under + the postman + darker
autumn rain + puddles fill falling + in the sky
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the day 's feet
almost dawn . . . + thoughts of you + when we were us
heartwood + the saw changes + in the moonlight
blind date + her face + on the sand
farmwife - + balancing among the sunset + with no one geese
twenty four seven -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
steady rain + a pale cloud + of snow
into dusk + the a carriage horse trots + up sixth
abandoned farmhouse + a yellowed grocery list taped + for the full moon
butterfly shadows … + my hand on her ear + does the lie
awoken at 4 am + an empty mind + electric summer
still in the early trees + of snow + from the cherry blossom snow
the brush + is dipped deeper + into the cold night + new a winter rain
all her hips + she warms her voice + after the shower
purple irises + stand still + to the rain
pinned butterfly ... + needle marks + on the girl ’ s
in the early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror
my change + but the dandelion + looks far away in my autumn day -- - + a quiet old couple
november sky -- - + the cat watches + a haiku butterfly
bombing + finally he comes out + as darkness
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
