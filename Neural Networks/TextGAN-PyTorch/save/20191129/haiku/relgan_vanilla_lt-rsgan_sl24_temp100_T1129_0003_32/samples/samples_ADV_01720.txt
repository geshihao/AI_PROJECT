brush + is dipped deeper + than the rain + a baby 's cry
forever waiting + for the ring of the phone + watching the rain
into home + the moon + from the ultrasound + a few a few + from the construction site
gibbous moon -- + finding new cyclamen leaves + in the sea
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
spring rain— + for the fire + new moon + instead
between the drone + of lawnmowers + a white cloud
heartwood + a dampness mushrooms from the washing + to drive me
as i pass the sky -- - + a white cat + at the rumor again
a sudden chill -- + my credit card + declined
six years + presents under here + birds without trees
emptied fountain + carried by the autumn wind + silt scent
plum blossom + slowly appear on the path + between the light
independence day— + the crows chatter muffled + by the day 's end
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
listening + to an incense stick + he squares his death date + to the family tree
( beach - + drops from an old temple + to i lost its back , + summer 's morning
all saints morning + a path + of trodden leaves
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
strategic plan - + sound of earth + crunching snails
winter solstice + candle too much + for the sparrow
roasted coffee + the taste of night + in the dusty sky
horizonless -- + sky-colored ice + turns lemon
twilight + the fog thick + over stone angels
harvest moon -- + too much much scent + hanging on the cold night
another button + lost along the way + lifting fog
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
the curved woman + just one more rainbow + into twilight
mothers ' + a small bowl + of imported ale
subway -- - + new york state green apples + flood the silence
buenos aires tango + the wish + goes on their list + ... another night-shift
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
