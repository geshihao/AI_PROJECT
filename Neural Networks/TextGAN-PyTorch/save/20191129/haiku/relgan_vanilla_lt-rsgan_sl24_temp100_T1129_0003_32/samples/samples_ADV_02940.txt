-- night + he cups up + a haiku lights
rush hour - + the silence + of the pond
breakup — + a faint essence + of mothballs
twilight ~ + an algebra me from the + insistent mantra
early morning + fog resting on cedars + cup of kona
summer evening + crescents of cantaloupe + on the empty street + late summer 's end
chilled wind tonight -- - + the fog rolling + for the parlor
starry fireworks + the sound of a fallen leaf + an old apple + tears
between doses + of cough medicine + silence
soft rain + fishing line parts + a cloud of gnats
into dusk + the winter killed grass + a swan 's whiteness + is full
beneath + the baby ’ s cry + of the splits old
asphalt + a tiny lizard + from the other end
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
soft rain + fishing line parts + a cloud of gnats
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
rearview mirror -- + pelicans with sunrise + on their wings
endless rain + the long sound of women + pounding rice
lightning at warm sky + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold
sunset -- - + she leaves conditioner + at the end of the world
desert chill -- + a late-night + visitor
evening souls + with divorce morning + how brittle the leaves + underfoot
late spring evening - + my best by one me + in the hedge
subway transfer + i watch the left + of the late train
the space + between etched names ... + war cenotaph
harmonica player + in silence + in the cold night
slice by slice + the pie disappears— + blueberry stains
bight of the river + where the child drowned + papyri in bloom
cold saturday night -- - + a carriage horse + flirts with another
afternoon fog -- - + nothing but ears + above the black snowflakes
fog + a few spots of red + first robins light
fireworks show + a woman too after + rain out of reach
