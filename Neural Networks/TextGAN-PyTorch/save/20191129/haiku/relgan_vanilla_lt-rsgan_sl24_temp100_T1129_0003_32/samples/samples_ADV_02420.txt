distant temple drums + close by the sound of + summer rain
a sea + inside the bright breeze + in the stars ...
on the hill + the ruins of the codfish + looks far away
evening fog -- + kerry concedes + a homeless tune out of the night + new a eye
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
morning rush -- - + nothing but ears + above the first snow
harmonica player + in so many potholes + an empty broken
strong wind + the sound of hammering + from haiku the sky
spring gale + raindrops on the raw wood + moonlight through sunlight
twilight -- + all that 's end + a jumping fish + even coffee
erosion sky + the last glimmering + of oystercatchers
herding a young deer + about the candles + her hymnal
typos + in her apology + and 'sold '
valentine 's day -- + awakened by a kiss + on your side of night
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the green grass
right after rain + the moon of moths reflection + and deep me
clouds gather + in the tea bag -- - + within a mackerel sky + for my favorite tree
-- night + too many flakes + a hot chill out + in the moon
chilled by cold snap -- + a birthday reminder + i do n't
quiet stable ... + a film of salt forms + on the bedroom wall
wind chime + my phone picks up + children waken screaming
new year + the calicantus morning + after many a garden + summer rain
through the fog -- + kerry concedes + the election
repeating sunset -- - + a dead used from the + rose scented
a soda can + shot full + of steaming spirits
in the hospital + the few spots of still + from the sky
twilight + with the lights clouds + between us -- - + a crescent moon
harvest moon -- + too much much light + darker
into dusk + the sound of my words + and mine
overcast -- + someone 's distant + evening rain
hot chocolate + the lingering scent + of nasturtiums
hot september -- - + a flat chested woman + enters the bird 's left
