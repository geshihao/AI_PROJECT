easter -- + another beach boys tune + on the oldies station
gone + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire + new moon
erosion ~ + the laundry tent + an unlocked moon
valentine 's day + a patch of + in the sun open noise
summer 's end— + cicada buzz caught + in the black cat 's mouth + over the last drops
sunrise -- - + a yogi does + her braids
the ides + of a boy heat + with no one spot at + a little bit of light
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of the furnace
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
silent flight + of the raptor + your breath + on the same page
midnight + the last glimmering + of oystercatchers
november dusk -- + the smell of burning leaves + on the red wine stain
almost + smell of rain + in the lobby
easter in time + a few blocks closer + than yesterday
thunder - + lavender leans + on the stone buddha
the recession -- + another night + without empty silver -- + a to look
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of their breath
church bells + she leaves her + at the empty garden + a fish 's mother 's name
hot chocolate + the i check + the summer 's + sunshine this snow
to a tiny world + unfolds and thrives - + spring . . rain + spring equinox
over monday coffee + the conversation of birds + with a walking + an old leaf
autumn chill + the mausoleum covered + warm again + with my bed
back home + the blossoms + turns rain
the last day + a wet maple leaf sticks + to the mattress
winter darkness - + last year + of the pond 's day
december rain — + how brave he was + to this autumn day
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
between the yoga + and chi gung classes -- + she 's wind + into hand to the roses
city traffic + cool morning + after the shower of + frogs at
first firefly + her thoughts + on the clothesline + our fight over the dustbin + ...
behind + citibank open + an oak-tree rises
storm -- + the monologue + in every night
