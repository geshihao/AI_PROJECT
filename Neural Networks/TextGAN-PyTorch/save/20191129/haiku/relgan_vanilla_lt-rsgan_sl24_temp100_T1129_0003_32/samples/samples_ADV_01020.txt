after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
early spring - + the horn + of a yellow cab
all saints morning + the path + a little louder + at the river ice
as the doctor leaves + caught + on the spring red station
empty teacup ~ + she reads the oncology report + backwards
rush hour + a light in the basement + a heat butterfly
as i pass the + steppingstone ends off + autumn rain
sudden rain + fallen on bare earth + steps in the mail + a mosque
the morning after + oak leaves cradle + last night 's last + without last night
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
an orange and pink sky + the last i wake + left by silence
the curved woman + with the passing monarchs + someone playing scales + on my comment
cafe for sale— + see the last words + in the wind
a sudden chill -- + the moon trapped + in the migrant 's fog
lunch at the cove + a butterfly about + the stillness
autumn chill + the mausoleum covered + with sparrows + fog dreams
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly of the day
warm rain -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
maple twig + turns lemon hue in the rain- + i reply for me
friday the 13th -- + a bit of volcanic ash + in the winter fog
sunny morning sea— + she tells the dandelion + empty sky
more piercing + in the empty + changes au lait + to the sky
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a day moon
new year + fireworks + a bee + talks in a tea , s + new year 's eve
long ago + the sound of a dog + nuzzles my hand
spring mist + the moon + and a dry + in the wind
january -- + the faint scent + of rain
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
harvest moon + the bigger pumpkin + waits for a ship ’ s apology + to the weight
our shadows + but the walls + but no more + into autumn wind
. your house + on the empty + broken up + at the seagull away
