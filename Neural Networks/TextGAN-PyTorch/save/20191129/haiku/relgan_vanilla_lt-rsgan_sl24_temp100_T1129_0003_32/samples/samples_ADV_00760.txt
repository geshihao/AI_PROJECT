despite the day + on the road + a little speaks + i think of lilacs + a rainbow
croton hedges + a plane + slice our silence + in the breeze
the may town + the silence + a spring sun + spring evening
the space + between etched names ... + war cenotaph + autumn in the wind
among the ripple + his brush + is that one oak + the last late evenings
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
a sudden chill -- + a late-night + visitor
autumn equinox -- + through sounds + spring dreaming
winter drizzle + all the heat + still inviting bees
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the clouds + the rain
sunny day + climbing + an ambulance in the open doorway + my darkness
autumn the hawk + the i lullaby + horse hooves heading a mosque + filled with pain
under a sky + the silence + our breaths out + in the shower
frozen pond— + white antlers rise + through the new funeral
one by snow + the landscape coming + to the young monk + a bird 's song
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a her warmth + old shoes
blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
a pagoda + in the wood of elder + rose drops in the + rose scented garden + summer solstice
midnight + at the blue clouds + and i remember + on the funeral
late winter rain + flowered umbrellas + sold out + in the same direction
midnight + the silence beyond + the streetlight
at the pow-wow— + they pass from the + the moon in the pines + a wind— the clouds
blood on barbed wire + a pale + in the autumn air
hiroshima day + the silence + on the table
spring mist + the silence + our breaths out + in teaspoons story
autumn mist + the tree i walk through + her butterfly net + a white toilet
cold rain + another just + of contrails
coffee rings + the first breeze moves + at the campsite + this morning light + her braids
news + an way across + the jogger 's + in the wind
moonless night -- + pulling the + on an of snow storms
hot chocolate + the silence beyond + the streetlight
