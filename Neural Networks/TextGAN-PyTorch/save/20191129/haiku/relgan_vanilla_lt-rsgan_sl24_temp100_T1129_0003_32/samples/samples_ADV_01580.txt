( beach - + snail and plastic bags + by the scent of the ocean + a heat wave
from the sky + first and i slow down + summer 's end
. + the stallion 's single kick + against the wall + degas ' ballerinas
more + the flirting free world + in the wind
yellow walnut leaves + the tea leaves + with mist
pint + of a sky - + autumn deepens
november night -- + a fat toad + leaves on the left
such coolness + the snail stretches + its tune light
shaking sky ... + a honeybee + without friends
snowy morning + a bee egg + in the fridge
overcast solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
darkened church + until a white moth + traffic noise penetrates + —two soaked monkeys
summer evening + crescents of cantaloupe + on the cold night + new a river 's eve
wind gust— + my children + one by one
apple slices- + our last leaves blown + in the stairwell
blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
your reflection + floating + not in the dead : + wind-puffed primroses
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
tired new mom - + brown leaves -- - + a poster of rain
long ago + the sound of a heat + at the ice cream cart
gandhi + closing in the air -- - + a gray moon shines + on the salt day
despite the day + clover bending + with the bee 's white + new year 's eve
snacking on the debt + i open my smile + at the shower
a vase + of wildflowers + brightening sky
wildfire haze -- + autumn + on the footpath
breakup — + sitting up the window + a winter moon + on the christmas ornaments
lingering morning -- + christmas boys + at the stars ... + a poster of the brewery
twilight + with the black woman + i hisses + a than .
unknotting + the hammock ropes + his brush
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + turns to the houses
winter drizzle + all the heat + a bee returns + over my haiku
