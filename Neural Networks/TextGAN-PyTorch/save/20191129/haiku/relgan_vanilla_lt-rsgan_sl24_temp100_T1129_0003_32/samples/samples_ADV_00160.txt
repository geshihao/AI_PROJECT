empty room ... + the old tombstone + keeps watch
a final date -- + mingling their ashes + in the lake
arizona + road stop rest , + the childhood 's rasp
deep silence + the orphaned nestlings + this third morning
no work today + the waves rush + memories of the fence
words + the sound of rain + interrupts her + in the cat ’ s
my snow + the wind-shifting and a bug + find each other
as old as i feel + on a gray silence + the scent
autumn leaves + a shooting star beneath + the wharf
church bells + she leaves her good intentions + in her hymnal
white cloud + a darkening path + the deep deep deep i left behind + the cockscomb ’ s red
deepening snow -- + a brightness from the kid + the dog shadow
cold rain + the greengrocer stacks cabbages + on cabbages
my father + the length + of our quarrel
winter rain + the christmas between + the night garden
basketball stops + the words he left + in the houses
a pagoda + in the wood of elder + the graves hotspot
sack of night + the oil salt white + in the sky ?
still and rain- + stirring extra sugar + to see the newborn
more piercing + in the room you in her + smell by rain
a wave of cirrus + left + autumn rain
beneath + the smell of water + under a black umbrella + at the pond
in the town + the scent + of unknown flowers + the apple tree
all saints day + the whistle of a distant train + going where ?
strong wind + spring the sparrows + tighter and tighter
of winter + blossoming in the bare feet + whisper by the light
the empty house + opens and closes + the poster of the brewery
the debt ceiling will rise -- + the house fills with + my braids
spring rain— + to the barbed-wire + wool in the rain + so far
a second glass of wine + morning in the child 's hand , + a rose
another birthday— + watching the long ash + on the incense
summer rain + finally he comes clean + about the spring
