exposed roots + the tree i still see + my brother ’ s eye + in the painted pony
darkening trees - + the sound of one + pounding rice
plum blossom + with the full moon ... + distant rain
early spring + everything + dripping
exposed roots + the tree i see - + rainless shadow
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly
mackerel sky -- - + a carriage horse + flirts with another
distant temple drums + close + the impressionist night 's beetle -- - + september starts to sunset
sixty day jail term— + as it grows shorter + on the painted pony
how some things end— + onion flakes + on the blue iris
the sun slips low - + suburban foxes + looting from bins
the sun slips + the carnelian red paving + a yellow smog that back summer + evening my hand
early spring - + yellow windows + in the blue moon
spring cleaning - + sound of a skill + in the wind
darkening trees + fills in half + her voice + after moonlight
chilly tea-time -- + finding new cyclamen leaves + on the old pond
overcast -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
september sunset -- - + a beggar wears + an orange coat
obituary + a child 's face + smiles from the page + first cup of coffee
our shadows + the sound of a bright + empty garden + summer heat
snowstorm— + another poem + too wordy
early spring + everything + dripping
tea of moon + filling up the end + a glimmer of light bulb + on the stars
all her dreams + there is rice + from the cloud-smudged sky
just friends — + the taste of summer + in the rain
murmur of thunder- + three lines of winter + without onions ...
sunday morning -- + the stars are + sunshine the stars ...
before my door + my daughter drawing circles ... + autumn equinox
early spring rain + read its letters + in the zen garden
hikers at dusk + spilling with shadows + out the canyon mouth
harvest moon -- + she leaves our atlas open + to her homeland
laundry encounter + a plastic shark + falls out to distant lot ... + a wave of barking
