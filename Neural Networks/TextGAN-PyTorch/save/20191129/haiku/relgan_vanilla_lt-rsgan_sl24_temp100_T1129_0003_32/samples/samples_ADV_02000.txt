long lasting rain + the doctor after + my shadow
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
june evening + someone playing scales + on the table
staring + the sweetness + on the red wine stain + spring in spring
between the yoga + of making soup + this winding of his back + from shore
sculpting + clay , in the + out of my 've mother 's eve + brogue
bridge in the darkness + my new year 's + rice rain
harsh by a dark -- + all parking of the + forest fire
rivulets + a rain at the window sign + autumn rain
death + of an old friend + the morning light + after the shower
after the solstice + this summer heat + still the painted pony -- -- + my coffee grows cold
friday after the air + graffiti + on my neck
tying a knot + a her hair + and moon
my daughter starts college -- + another empty + pint of beer
poetry books + banished to over the chair + i watch the new year
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly
vesta + along the leaves + caught in the darkness
logging road— + the pileated woodpecker + flings its back , + winter rain
valentine 's day + and warm rain + i those stars
faltering day + the agonized roars + as the old oak dies
pranayama— the window + half of your black + an old man + ... another
waiting for warm rain - + wondering under + a fat cricket
storm -- - + a yogi does + an orange coat
just friends — + a taste of summer + in the empty trees
fridge magnet - + snack after snack + wasting away in the fog
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
spring rain— + the gravedigger latches + more in her tea , in the middle + ... another
unknotting + the hammock ropes + his brush
may dawn ... + a salt morning -- - + no more sand in
morning haze -- - + my neighbor brushing her hair + to a train window
a pagoda + over the bottle + moonlight on my face
slate skys + chalk mark outlines + on the sidewalk
