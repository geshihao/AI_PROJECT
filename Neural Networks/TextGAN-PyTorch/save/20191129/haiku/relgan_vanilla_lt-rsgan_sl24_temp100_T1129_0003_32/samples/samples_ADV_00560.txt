church ruins + the grace + of a single leaf + on the blue moon
june night + the cyclist + without day + after the green trees
the crunch + of the first leaf + under a tea + and moon
a tiny world + unfolds and thrives + another wish + goes on the rice wine
moonless night + a stone into the pond + sprinklings of moon
blue sky -- + all the + sunshine + and sky
dawn -- + the monologue + of every tree ... + the sun in dark
autumn seabreeze ... + the silence beyond + the streetlight
still and the hawk + the first scent + of a water ... + ice
spring + painting + a light in the basement + and slow i slow to spring + summer 's end
spring mist + the tree i take + into the scent + of rain
no work today + the waves rush + memories in his pot + in the hands tearing rain
lingering + a light in the chestnut + fills in the river + a skunk 's warning
between the drone + my window + rain on my thoughts + ... the plans
moonless night + the cyclist + without lights + after an open zone
sunset + i let tea leaves + release the tannins + blue flashing lights
photo shopping + snowflakes + on the last step + you turned
beneath + no smell + of a bottle + of fireflies
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder ! + in the parking lot
the ides + of a boy heat + with a text + ...
snow + mixed rain + finally round the sunrise + a winter moon + on the blue plate
the wind + the echo of a cuckoo + the silence + of water
the wind + in the wind + the morning sun + the morning sun
a dull ache + settles deep + inside the last day
death watch + the scent + of rain
first firefly + a small crack and there + on the sky + on the snow
change in pitch + as the doctor + & through the sky
early spring + the minty freshness + of his death + still uncarved
at the lawn concert + lighting the + insistent mantra
hazy skies + drifts of dead fir + the winter moon
barn owl + a fence + at the last leaves blown + from the to view night
the river wind + an amish foot softly + the rain has + the last rose
