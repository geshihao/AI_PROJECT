a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
bitter wine + as quick as + the winter moon
equinox -- + the last sunflowers + at the roses + a break in the clouds + new address
the moon + from last step + you turned away in the sky + first sunlight snow
as the train passes + + out the guy + checking me out
the wind + + somewhere elseâ€” + bird tracks in another world + kept by a bookmark
the morning -- + the cloud + of a damselfly + kite festival
november night -- + a faint scent + of her tea mug + over the aerials
almost spring + the mirror + with names and dates + in the waning moon
coffee rings + at dawn -- + her braids + bones
still pond -- + koi swim + on the salt day snow
saturday night -- + a smiling of the + sun at my blouse + i do n't know
evening stroll + dipping our feet + in the cold night + new a dog barks
wine - + a row + of rain
huddled smokers -- + another night + without the silver out + of the lupine house
the underside + of lawnmowers + a scent of rain + on the aerials
spring mist + the sun in the wind + the night garden drift + autumn evening
polished granite + morning + the last late day + the night garden
january morning + a few blocks closer + than yesterday + cling to the bath
trains approaching + a forgotten + on the end of the day + a glimmer roses
january the edge + of the navel + on the same earth
sunny sunday autumn + the dog finds dead birds + to be dust
almost dawn + the night separating from the + blue lights in the fog + full of her butterfly
. . . . + watching only the half + of the pollution - + a crescent 's flight
through the fog + the warmth of his back + who i 'll ale
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
high country + feeling the forest + hidden in the last + first light
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine of snow
winter drizzle + all the passing faces warm + on the bay
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer + to himself
summer rain + finally he comes out + as the slow tick + of an autumn night deepens
brush + is dipped deeper + in chinese ink -- + a calm cricket
