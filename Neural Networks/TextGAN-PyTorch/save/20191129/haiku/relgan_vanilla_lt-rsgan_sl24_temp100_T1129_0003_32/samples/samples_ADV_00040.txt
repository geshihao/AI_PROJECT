dark days + another cat opens + a little speaks
death + a light of snow + a spring in the street + sunset
darkening path + the little louder + from the last vows
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat
approaching winter rain + another just 's + bright light
fence - + a sunbird + left standing
high winds + the tea leaves . . . the gray + her hair
left by simmer + the darkness + near the fire
break up + in the empty house + a day moon
my old garden + wallpaper peeling to a dark -- - + the still at sunset
stinging hailstones - + the bass 's moon + through leaves
close lightning + the metallic taste + a in his old eyes -- + chilled wind
tai chi ~ + the sound of a woodpecker + shifts again
morning tai chi ~ + a breeze stirs the spent petals + the smell of snow
up in the stars . . . + a shooting star beneath + the blossoms
airport autumn + outside the embassy + plaque polishing
so many ways + within the waterfall + for us
dawn + a small bowl + of imported ale
indian summer - + he tunes his guitar + beside a pole
new year 's day + the only and i 'll + into the text
first pussy willows -- + the same earth + in the rain
the snow -- + my credit card + declined
walking to a raindrop + down the sun + down a river coat
as i used to french + the rose i meant to pluck . . .
black friday + the rainbow between + my last rose
late my day moon + the moon dances + on the wall
thunder + barely through the blinds + from the mirror 's swale need
close lightning + from the photo at the old life + of the same yard
gloomy afternoon + my neighbour sunday in the window + with pain color
end of the weekend + august full moon rises + as days shorten
day long rain + my new dahlias too + scent of yellow rose
the underside of leaves + i watch the sound of women + pounding rice
