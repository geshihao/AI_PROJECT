death + the fog makes the + mirror , this sky + a face
into dusk + the fog makes the mirror + a fish + i louder
from under the bare + the moon + and a slow day + a moon
morning -- + my mother 's + rice paper skin
spring cleaning + the graffiti + in the wall
at sunset + the a cup + of bad it 's + a white butterfly
the ides + of a snail + to show the front wheel + the spring
old roses + blooming again + insomnia
new year + fireworks + on the wall + degas ' ballerinas + the bed
new year + fireworks + the stillness of rain + so much louder + on the rain
the recession -- + she tells the mirror + in the cold night
his line + the year + a street light still + on the snow
egrets + in the distance ... + ice in the window + a winter coat
slipping + beneath the kitchen door + -first sunlight + in the sea
alongside time + along the riverside + ... another night-shift
hot september night -- + my mother + serves
desert wind + the words he left + and mine
a day moon + the silence + the tip of his eyes + over cold champagne
spring morning + a butterfly + from the shells + slow of the plans
the blank page + learning nothing + a continuous moon
over monday coffee + the conversation of + the old house + the old man
weathered ' + the sweetness + left behind and copper + waning a mile
a touch + the moon breaks through + the firework smoke + seen before the day ?
my father + the i 'll a magpie + and the day moon
the glare off + the new neighbors + with the white snow + the first time
a moth flies + through the reeds + that touch her hair + that silence
winter wind— + the sun + after many of silence + a snow
day + the flowers + between the icebergs
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
tired new mom + the waves rush + memories of us
half moon + the silence + on the wall + degas ' ballerinas
