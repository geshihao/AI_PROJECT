rain + mixed with the + forest , all my + a winter moon
melting tar + silk cotton drifts + across two continents
new year + fireworks + the trail of the leaves + on the wall
the starless night + a lone skater spins + around the moonlight
rosebud unfolding + the silence + on the wall
blind + with the first cup + wind ... + the same green + it in the wind
chocolate + replete with liqueur + hot shiver
the courtship -- + the monologue + of every rain
what thing cries + i wash + the spring tide
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + in the blue china night
ripe corn + patches between + chest with rain + their snow fort
darkening spring + a lizard in the + left up through + the croaking of frogs + ... another
the taxi driver + tells me about + back into the ground + a white plum blossom rain
in the darkening yard + a tiny lizard + from the tiny world + of tree
dry stream bed + clouds drift + above the train the way + a clouds
winter drizzle + all the world + of snow
sudden shower + cursing the umbrella + the last night
an old lady called + into the quarter + an egret 's laughter + still fills the kitchen
twilight rain + the moon + on the last streetlight + our fingers
the thanksgiving meal + down her clothes + her braids
on the hill + morning in the quarter + an shadows of coffee + from the tree . . . + just out of
harsh by one + in the strong morning + tsunami
hot september -- + a nasturtium burns + the tip of my thoughts + on the fire
the sound + of a faded flag + with the first scent + ... the taste
long lasting rain + and then i remember + earth day
news + the house through the window + the first drop of sweat + on my phone
call the traffic + a white barn with painted + butterflies
its four reflection + floating in the tea cup + too hot night + this life in the field
hot chocolate + the sound + of a computer keyboard + midnight solitude
rivulets + of an end + a white + inside the snow globe
all saints morning + the path + of trodden leaves
news + the crowns + of the silence + our silence + in the cat ’ s cry
