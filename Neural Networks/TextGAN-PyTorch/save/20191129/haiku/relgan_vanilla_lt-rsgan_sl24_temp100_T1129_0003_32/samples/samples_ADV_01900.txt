summer solstice + candle too much + for the last night
. under + the neighborhood snowmen + of a mirror
snuffing the flame + the quiet room + quieter
slice by slice + sakura cherry blossoms + in the wind
half river - + the sound of a ladder + lengthening
breakup kiss ... + my barber points out + a traffic with mouth
sleety rain + flowered umbrellas + sold out
a shower - + cormorants ' flights + waves lapping
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks shelter + on the rain
roman deep silence + ... homeless + in the spring open
from under the dock + come the canada geese + in the headlights
arizona + road stop rest , + along the highway + a single magpie
cloudy + with its grey hair + on the table
questions + purl like schools of fish + and splits ...
frosty morning + your slice of our bedroom + but moonlight
indian summer + turkey feather falling + just one feet
endless rain + the dentist â€™ s drill + turning to bloom
wakes the last + dragonflies escape from + the path home
tired new mom - + brown to the car window + on the pine
summer solstice + candle too much + for the parlor
guid friday - + cruciform a maw snuves + athort the lift
winter thunder + only the paving + do n't need batteries
a spider and afternoon fog + pierces along the river + a drop of light
wind + lily petals fall + in the open mouth + of summer rain
quiet dawn- + the sound of hammering + from the construction site
wildflowers + of the heat + of love here and death + in the dark
dark days -- - + as i pass her curtains + end of the sea
the river jam - + no line + at evening
chilly tea-time -- from + winter moths + at the salt air
a red shaft of + we tired shoppers + wait for in the free
starless night + finding an old flame + on the garden
juice from the apple + runs into the in the + bathtub playing
