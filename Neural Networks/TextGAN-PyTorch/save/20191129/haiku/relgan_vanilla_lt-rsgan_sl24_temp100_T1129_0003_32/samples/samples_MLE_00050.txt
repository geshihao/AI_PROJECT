hot window + my heartbeat quickens + through his avalanche zone
valentine 's day + photo of a missing girl + flutters in the sun
in the far petals , + my evening
my son 's eleventh birthday -- + miles of the last sun + burning itself
autumn riff + aspen a cloud + from the syringe
road closed + moose tracks continue + in the fire road
oh sign laid rest + with weeds + in each mirrors
new summer 's end + old shoes + still a back in the city + fishing fishing fishing
warm air . . . + the scent of approaching rain + hard to catch the moon
valentine 's day + christmas leaves + the single magpie from tea -- + the mosquito
no moon + the hiss of + falling drifts
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of a quarter house
a line of traffic lights + cool resting on again . . . + thunder !
new light of my childhood -- + koi swim + for so young sleep
blue sky -- - + she pencils in the sunset -- - + moonless of cooking
cloudless sunset -- - + my neighbor puts + in her underwear
mother 's life on the hawk -- + the cloud of in the wave
twenty four seven + the echo of its the bucket + in the past tense
by . . my again + a single of the rain forest + freckles in my morning
another button + warm in the crow 's nest + crescent moon
the ferry -- + bird songs of + her kiss
thunder snow + your reflection glides + to egret on the grave mouth
the recession -- - + a yogi does he + on the wrong door door
strategic plan - + a fox picks its way + across the mountain road
silent flight + the first meteors and me + in my teacup
call on the boy -- + afraid to + i turn on my
breakup — + finding an old flame + beyond the sun
a furniture store + where the church used + of the straw voice
ash wednesday + they still lean me + on the incense dead ? + the car geese
on the beach- + the hawk searches + the path home
young lovers again + the warmth of a plane + against again
sleepless night - + outside the pale moon + without a carriage
