pan-fried trout + a faint essence + of thunder
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
stifling heat + with the passing driver + nobody i remember when + she dreams betrays
half time + the rain + of the april
early spring + everything + dripping
music + the little marked + watch the letterbox
empty bus stop + of corral fencing— + wind in the clover
rivulets + a crows marked + by autumn rain
neither white nor black + the winter moon + on the wall
plum blossom + with the moon + and the sound of the train + graffiti
decorating my cell again + i notice roommate— + a silverfish on my pillow
almost dawn + the night separating from the + of an tide
independence day— + the scars + of its healings
four am ~ + an algebra boys + in the wind , then
overcast -- + just one more game + of solitaire
weathered wall- + the smell of fish + along the highway + an egret preens
the early trees + of the heat + opens of home
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus breaks + on the calendar -
that long-ago kiss + she leaves our atlas open + her braids
passes by its -- + there might be + on the moon
indian summer - + crescent moon + without the silver hook
at sunset -- - + the clean up + after the green grass
sack of cheeries ~ + the baby ’ s cry + of us
rose + in the masks + on the red wine
blue sky -- - + she tells another lie + to a white butterfly
good news + from the cardiologist + autumn leaves
train window + the landscape coming + to an old house + after the shower
another button + lost along the way + lifting fog
my tea gets colder + a magpie from the + of summer heat
wildflowers + the many voices + of a leans + share a puddle
eyeing + a few crows from here + a new fence
autumn shower - + a faint essence + of an old house
