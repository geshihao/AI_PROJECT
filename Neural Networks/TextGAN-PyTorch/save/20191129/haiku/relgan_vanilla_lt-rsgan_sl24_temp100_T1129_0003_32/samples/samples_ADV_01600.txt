a lake + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the last 's day + from her last rain
juice from the apple + runs into my beard + smell of her rain
autumn mist -- + even the stones + a winter sun
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter
waiting for + in the salesman 's lapel + memorial day
taking time . . . + listening + to the grocery clerk
subway transfer + the homeless lady + sells mirrors
after each haiku— + the pencil + a little shorter
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
hunter night -- + cherry leaves heavy + with rain
. . . . + her laugh echoes + through the empty house
moon gazing + fogging up the window + from the temple the ring + of his brush
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly
distant temple drums + close + near the floating + down the mountain
hot -- + the faint scent + of the easter lily
is smile + all day long earth + evening my hill
typos + in her apology + spring weeds
indian reservation - + in the wind + to moth lights
geese honking + the sound of a ladder + lengthening
moon gazing + fogging up the window + for an old man towels + himself in the sunlight
humid morning -- + my hands recalling + this shadows in grey light
rose + on the empty couch + scratch of her bare trees + the same green
pan-fried trout + an walking stick pierces + in the moonlight -- - + a poster of his line
snowballs + her seasonal cookies + eaten one by one
pan-fried trout + the cry of the mourning dove + wintering day
beneath + an fog over the wall + of sky
friday + an unknown bird + a child asks + if i have dreams
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat -- - + a poster of mccain
chinese market - + my breath clouds + on these white rocks , talking of + nothing but darkness
weathered wall- + the smell of rain + on asphalt
a block breeze -- + after many seagull + night
approaching winter -- + my walking stick pierces + crusted snow -- -
