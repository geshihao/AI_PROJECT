spring fever + the silence beyond + the streetlight
silver after the rain + i read his letters + in the shade
a few petals + autumn chips -- - + moonless night
daylight fades -- + all the moon + on the lights
the glare off snow + the morning deep + gone
waiting for + to ask + under the stars
oh moon -- + i remember how much much + for no stars
all her coat -- + her husband in the chair + not worth keeping
airport window + someone else 's summer + strewn down the night + new summer 's end
lingering day + of many women + still the new shoots + lost in her eyes
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
late winter rain + nobody i know + in the obits
a dull ache + settles deep + inside the sky
at sunset + fisherman rests + river flows on . .
through the bombing + and parked cars + morning in the leaves geese
tools rusting + unused on the work bench + summer 's morning air
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
memory care unit + snowflakes melting + on the sea
dark days of winter - + hot beach + at the strip mall
breakup â€” + the winter moon + outside the pine
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
late winter - + copper wishes collect + in the bottom of the well + mum at dusk
domestic terrorism -- - + she leaves our atlas + in the laurel
sleety rain + flowered umbrellas + sold out
spring fever + between our argument - + a dragonfly in the sun + the orange juice
onion skin + from the stars . . . + just dull light + her braids
church ruins + the grace + of a single leaf falling leaves + my cancer
twilight + the graffiti + of my divorce
early spring -- + my mother storm + opens of a mirror
november dusk -- + my shadow + also 's homeless
shrilling cicadas + two women smile + at something else
cloudy + a faint essence + of her voice
