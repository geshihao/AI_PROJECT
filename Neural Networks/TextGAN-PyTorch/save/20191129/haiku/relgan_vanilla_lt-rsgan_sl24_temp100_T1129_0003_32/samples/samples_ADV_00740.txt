new year + the calicantus morning + at the park + from the mirror + a fish i never know
drought + a dampness in the washing + left out overnight + with nothing
leafless maple + white silence + on the stone buddha + eaten one by the spring + spring again
new year + the calicantus morning + with a snail look + the express weight
he looks at her + stands the + insistent mantra
change in pitch + as the sound of + a heat storm + and morning snow
twilight + with the blue heat + dragonflies escape from + the convict 's pencil + so immobile
death + of a raptor + your breath + while they
concert in her tea + and moon + on my vegetable patch + in the lake
party of a sermon + on the wall + in the rain geese
a second glass + a morning + at the phone + a winter coat + in his razor
green rimmed eye + in the cold spring + the winter field + of fireflies
autumn rain + puddles drops + and a leaf in the line + of the sea
sudden rain + and i slow down + near the floating + all day long
the recession -- - + a flat chested woman + enters the wrong rest room
my morning + a in the bare + with the clock bed + the winter rain
overcast + until a white moth + traffic noise + through the sky
death + in the strong wind + the taste of goodbye + in the scent of rain
news from overseas + the child 's tomb + smell of rain
keep an eye + on the edge + of the disused youth + the autumn wind
delta blues + the hum + of a power highway + new tea
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the spider web
how some things + the last whistle of + a light in the house snow
late winter rain + my socks + on the last streetlight
grey surrounds + wind blows + in the car 's air + a can window
starless night -- + the sound + of a woodpecker + shifts again
a sudden chill -- + my credit card + declined
where the ripple was + the fisherman casts his line ; + the old apple + from old eyes
half moon + the sound of my words + on the blue iris
the underside + of lawnmowers + a wait 's last + in the rain geese
a block breeze -- + a bit + lost in the cold spring + towards the rest + sprinklings wave
full summer -- + the sound of + a dragged christmas ball + under foot
