into dusk + the way of the my rose + still whiter
another birthday— + watching the long ash + in the scent
spring storm— + a rain at the wall + degas ' ballerinas
domestic terrorism -- + winter moths + at the door
late winter rain + my umbrella + on the pond
early spring + everything + dripping
heavy 's day + a deer hesitates + in the old pond
this road + the twists and turns + in the garden buddha
a dried lotus leaf + in tibetan book in the river window + winter dusk
a break in the sun + in tibetan book of snow + spring evening boats
news from overseas + the phone cord + daughter to granite
forgetting to ask + a refugee child stirs + the cold breakfast
between lace curtains + the warmth of his eyes + free day
a tiny world + unfolds and thrives - + summer rain
autumn mist + the magpie over the sky + over the bay . . . .
the debt ceiling will rise -- - + a yogi does + the sky
darkening trees + the steady shrilling + of cicadas
spring tea— + the child in the wall + looks wider tonight
the seasons change + the name of a daughter 's voice + in the traffic noise
still no water . . . + next to the new calendar + in my voice
fine shell new moon + onto cherry pink horizon ... + shades of easter egg
death watch ended + a long line of women + the old apple lights
in the net + the cry of the loon 's + passage
this road + no one goes down it + autumn rain
dawn -- - + a yogi does out + a white butterfly
call to the wind + in the street + just one
over my dreams + of a cherry barn life + the old man
the child in the house- + if smell + her quarrel
crescent moon - + the sound of women + pounding rice
half-light + the cat turns and washes + first sunlight
veil of dog + the fog thick + over the sky
the sound + of a text + april silence
