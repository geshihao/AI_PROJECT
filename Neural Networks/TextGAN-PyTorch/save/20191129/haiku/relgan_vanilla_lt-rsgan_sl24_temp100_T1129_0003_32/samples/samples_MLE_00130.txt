winter evening solstice + the widow tightens + a playing 's time
afternoon nap + the hippopotamus opens her eyes + to cover the table
wedding anniversary + does he still love + over the red
ash wednesday + a mosquito + the funeral
the courtship songs + of so many birds -- + wind through the sky
in the taste + of afternoon rain washes away + children tea
darkening path + snowflakes + a sun has the window
far end + from a cow ’ s chin + along the highway
rain clouds - + white wings and blue sky + next new year
past midnight + the child 's face + smiles from the tree
day 's end - + the patter of raindrops + on my rooftiles
lonely time + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
shortest day -- + the train whistle + of a dove cart
four am night + she tucks the friend passes + to one one to one
morning chill + the mausoleum covered + with sparrows
walking to work a cry + of a loon smoke
no longer a new crop + two this morning and sky
seed catalog + the colours + of a poem
fireworks show work ? + my neighbor 's + for one to the night river
night shift -- + the sun reaches the sun + to watch the stars
a dry rose + a street still the phone + to show a cherry
hot chocolate + the scent stronger + this summer heat
patriot 's day -- - + a cobra escapes from + the bronx zoo
longest night— + the lingering taste + of apple pie
morning tai chi ~ + a breeze stirs the spent petals + to the cherry blossoms
equinox -- + a photo of a missing girl + flutters in the breeze
after harsh words + over the bouquets + of the house hour
winter morning day -- - + the barmaid kisses me + of the sky
empty lot . . . + another grandchild + with the weight of a train
a dry maple + in the sky + over the bay
cold of winter rain -- - + my neighbor left + on his glasses
the grey spring -- - + i still check out a white + for no lipstick
