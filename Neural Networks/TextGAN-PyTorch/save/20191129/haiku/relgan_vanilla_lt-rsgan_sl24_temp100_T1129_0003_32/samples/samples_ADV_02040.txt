a cut glass bowl + holds the shells + of a single leaf on the leaves + day
sack of cheeries ~ + the new is slow drip + then the sax tells mountain
hot beach sand ... + between the tree i + to see the newborn
early spring + everything + dripping
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
january -- + a few flat buddha + another universe
seed catalog + the same haiku + about appear
early spring - + new graffiti + shaped like a for sale , + spring old temple
between the yoga + two well 's tree + an perfect apples ' dry tree
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in the houses
twilight -- - + i keep recounting + how many santas
as i pass the sky . . . + a new year + spill down
the night watchman + almost touch + drifts past orion
news + a crows chatter muffled + by rain silence
into dusk + the fog makes the world + of smoke
summer stars— + she tells + a kiss of light
beach stroll + dipping our feet + in the bird 's buried
keep an eye open + he hisses + in deep dark shadow
independence day— + the scars this + slowly her lips
my ford explorer + on the branch i + summer 's end
rabbit trail + i write + inside us
the solstice + this smell + of sea rain
through the window + half of your black + smell of rain + puddles of lavender
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of sunset
how some things end— + onion flakes + on the blue iris
bleached driftwood + she tells + the end of the path + a winter coat
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for a touch of home
blind date + her face + on the cold night
train whistle . . . . + palm prints linger + against the glass
party of autumn + a light in the basement + of summer heat
guid friday - + cruciform a maw snuves + athort the lift
removing her wedding ring around + a deer + with an old man + to the old elm
