to the graveyard + grey open the sugar + and the young monk + ... dark
all day + the agonized roars + as the old oak dies
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
your reflection + floating in a tea cup + too hot to drink
mackerel sky -- - + no milk + of the wrong train
my palm tree + few fire-flies + in the concrete
almost dawn + the side of the + forest floating - + autumn leaves
wants to simmer + the kettle shrieks + until answered
overnight snow + without opening + summer rain
slow steady rain + my new dahlias too + look in the clouds
early spring + everything + dripping from his eyes + in the headlights
ursa major + a white barn with the weight + of a single leaf + ... sea
east river -- + the faint scent + of my eyes ...
chilled wind + sweeping the temple + zealously
darkening trees + a lizard + on corrugated iron
grey today + all the rain + over the bay . . . + winter sparrows
doing up + the cry of the loon + just before the loon 's laughter + leans to another
the wind + blue corn chips -- + more rings playing clear -- - + more conversations
gazing at + a faint glow + from the refinery night
equinox -- + the last sunflowers + into lullaby + a hooves fish
late winter winter -- -i pass + the lingering warmth + of this old deck chair
solstice + after an unknown bird + ... the child 's + i he still check it out + to the rain
into dusk + the fog makes the mirror + a winter
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
king with armour + a mantle of snow + on the blue moon
my tea gets colder + on a gray window + smell of rain
herding + the autumn heat + into twilight
august days -- + from the road ring longer + still wrapped
darkening trees + our shrinking in the river fence + a skylark 's song
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
indian summer + runs into the road + of the late night
oh moon -- + an empty + rice playing mirror + this haiku
