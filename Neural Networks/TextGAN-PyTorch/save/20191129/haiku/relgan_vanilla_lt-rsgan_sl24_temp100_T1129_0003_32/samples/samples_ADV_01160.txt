a sudden chill -- + my credit card + declined
just friends â€” + the moon + on the pine of loneliness
hot chocolate + green tips + of onions his death date + to the garden
confucius + another long path + to the deep light
a dried lotus leaf + on the branch + new moon
for out + a blackbird with new the fence + a love table in bare
pint of + a text + april silence
running home ... + the murmur of waves + slowly changes
an orange and pink sky + the last summer twilight + in the shower
lingering hair + on the walls traces + but not the ring + of the ocean
a spider 's web + across this reach + on her side of a bag rain
on my smartphone + mount fuji in the sunset + after morning 's hurricane
overcast sky -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
a sudden chill -- + opening the windows + to its last
into dusk + a few petals + by last night 's dream + a winter sun
herding + the moonlight + one after one
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
sudden rain + my new dahlias too + look so faded
almost dawn + the night separating from the + of his white butterfly
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
away from the fog -- - + a witch passes me + on his shoulders
in the net + half of a text + with the last nail + from my city hour
harsh by one + fireflies escape from + the convict 's pencil + hard rain
first firefly ... + a few blocks closer + than yesterday
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the teabag
midnight night -- - + the cat watches + on a butterfly
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
freeze warning -- + the bright red glare + of the new fence
a sudden chill -- + my credit card + declined
airport window + mixed in the forest + all the child 's call + of night
wall-to-wall clouds + the river bigger + in the wind
