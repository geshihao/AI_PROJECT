weathered wall- + a hint of the height marks + left behind
mixed precipitation -- -- + a flat finish + on fire
twenty four seven + the soft silence + of snow
from under the dock + autumn leaves + on the blue iris
one by one + fireflies escape from + spring cleaning morning -- -
geese honking -- + my light beer + outside the nursing home
starless night -- + a smiling of the daffodils + in the wind
deepening snow -- + after the jasmine + until a haiku
first firefly - + her gray sweater lifts + to show his death date
taking time . . . + listening + to the grocery clerk
on the hill + i wish i could give you + about my autumn day
a lake -- + after many watch + in the wind
erosion ~ + a flattened possom + in the road
homesick— + sundown just behind + to the stop
drought- + weeds sprouting + near the sprinkler
a second glass of wine + has the park + on the garden
from under the dock + the poor woman + sings out
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
monday spring morning + ant traffic on the main stem + of a satellite dish
hot beach sand ... + between two trains back + speaks in cockney
thousands of river stones + the child 's wall + soften her says something
deep silence + falls from the trees + a homeless man warms himself + hand to mouth
snowstorm— + another poem + too wordy
november rain + seeps slowly , slowly + just one by one + a heat wave
no work today + her husband complains again + of coon tracks
deep sign + with its grey + one after roses
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
almost dawn + a drunk pisses + in today the ice . . .
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
all her dreams + only two passengers + speak ...
late winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
a day hides + the sound of a fallen leaf + turns one path
