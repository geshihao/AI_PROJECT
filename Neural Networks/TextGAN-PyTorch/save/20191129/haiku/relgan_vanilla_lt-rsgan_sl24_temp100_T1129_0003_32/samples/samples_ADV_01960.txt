enlightment -- + a police car + on fire
desert twilight -- - + a gm car + needs a push
mountain storm + somewhere during its echo + the thunder ends
questions + purl like schools of fish + i open a child 's hand , then + this butterfly
mid-autumn + the wildflowers + in the bottle street + a single bud opens + to right itself
at the memory + of suburban + still the first time
my ford explorer + with the doctor lights + a little deeper
autumn equinox -- + my baseball glove + right where i cry
a spider 's web + across this reach + a little bit of his death date + in her smile
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
into dusk + the fog makes the mirror + a walk interrupted
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the pine
meditating and + resplendent in sunlight + this morning my wake + on wall street
ursa darkened ~ + the silence + a absent + of black coffee
examinations -- - + my neighbor prays + in the wind
she 's found + sound of a skill + in my beer bottle
vanishing difference . . . + gliding geese settle onto + my youth
rice-green pond -- + koi swim + through the cloud
weathered wall- + the smell of leaves + of the sea
loosening + a fish i + to the prison fence + a winter heat
where dirty snow + meets heat world + once a flooded schoolhouse + as he passes out
all saints morning + a path + of trodden leaves
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the teabag
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
cool breeze -- - + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the spider web
fresh peaches -- + the wet print of your body + on the pool deck
broken cold + dreaming + of a dried buddha + eaten one
logging roadâ€” + the pileated woodpecker + flings its back , the clouds + this winter berries
he looks at her -- + my breath clouds on our arms + extuinguished by wind
clear sky + the last glimmering + of oystercatchers
equinox -- + splitting + the last of the wine + ... another
all saints morning + i watch the rising + of an empty house
