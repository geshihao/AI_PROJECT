after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
wolf from warm winter rain -- - + nothing but the window + on the same page
molten by itself— + a faint essence + of mothballs
dawn -- - + a black woman + with no one
midday stars . . . + to watch the new year + lingering warmth
february rain - + every mile or so + to the marks -- his death date + and autumn rain
wildfire haze + the same earth + waiting waiting
from under the dock + come the canada geese + one by one
bight of the fence + a constellation + of loneliness
sudden fog -- - + my neighbor prays + in the rain out
dying afternoon + bay and islands in fog + aroma of coffee
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
early spring + . . . . + the fallen leaf + of her breastcancer ...
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of winter
's cleansing + beneath the kitchen door + -first sunlight
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
nobody 's tree + the poor woman + behind her other + to see her face
equinox -- + splitting + the last of the wine + the path home
bus window - + she travels with me + in the rose
bight of the river -- + my credit card + declined
zen garden + after each storm + from the computer screen
almost dawn -- + all that cups the windows + to the fly
glinting on her voice + carrying eggs + across the ice ice
valentine 's day + ... horses browse + through the broken 's wake
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
crystal morning + dried puke + on the car door
honking through + borders ' turnstiles - + starvation 's bones
ebb tide + the last glimmering + of oystercatchers
a construction site + the ups guy knocks + across porch boards
a spider 's web + three saffron-robed birds + a faucet dripping
juice from the apple + runs into my beard + as i wait for you
summer stars . . . + the way small birds + new shores
