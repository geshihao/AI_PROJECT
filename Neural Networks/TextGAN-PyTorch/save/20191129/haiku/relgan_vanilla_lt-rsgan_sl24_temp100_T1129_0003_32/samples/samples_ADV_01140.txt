cold snap -- + a few flat + of snow
dawn + a small bowl + of imported ale
the river hurricane + her grandchild quickens + my thoughts on a cold morning + morning in the shower
cloudless night + someone on the platform + a carnelian in the window + a whisper of still
icy conditions - + another slide + on wall street
late winter rain + my socks + on the salt air
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of sunset
between the sun + someone of the dead sparrow + the winter sun + under the past 's memorial
oh spring + a faint breeze moves + its green around
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
summer rain + finally he comes out + as the news 's end
where do + the way + you open my put out + my butterfly
poetry books + banished to over the + blue sky
sack of the woods + some things i may not want + to our silence
dog barks + somebody , + with a text + april rain
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
from under the dock + the night adds shadows + in the dark
not one word + can in my hands -- - + a sun in the cat 's to house
mist over my dreams + fallen on bare earth + evening rain
another birthday— + watching the long ash + on the incense
wave from her wedding + dreaming + of my ex-wife
farmwife from - + she travels with + rain in the breeze
indian summer + the sweeping + the day seems + becoming at the sky
thunder on wires - + a homeless man + to another window
leaves potato chips + nobody can write + just one
autumn evening + an old barn woman + after shades of rain + after the shower
midnight + the silence beyond + the streetlight
summer salad -- + a nasturtium burns + + the tip of my thoughts
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the rain . . . + a storm cloud
autumn mist + the tree i walk through + her needle -- - + a poster of mccain
high winds + on the island of lights + after one green
alongside time + along the riverside + ... another night-shift
