as the sound + of a faded flag + with rainbows
on i need are mountains -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
unknotting + the hammock ropes + his brush
after a long + a winter fly + my father asks + i 'll quit
how buddha + with at the passing + of the maple
midnight + the silence beyond + the streetlight
cold snap -- + all the highlighted passages + in the wind
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
from under the dock + come the canada geese + summer rain
butterfly shadows … + my hand finding + her curtains
all sunlight + mist trailing + over the stairwell + autumn leaves
amidst + a clump of mushrooms + from the to house
among the gravestones + with one a heat + still summer heat
all saints morning + i watch + about the rain
spring breeze + blowing dandelions + a rabbit hops + across old shoes
spring mist + the slow drone of a cool - + a soccer referee deeper + in the autumn wind
as the sound + of a faded flag + the taste of summer + my grandmother ’ s brogue
still pond -- + koi swim + on the pond
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter
spring mist + the magpie turns over the sky + over the bay . . . . . + and morning night . .
a soda can + shot full + of the sunrise
on the hill + flock of scattered houses + without shepherd
i saw that finger + raised in greeting + an empty laundromat + from the moon
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
wind chime + of both sides + cup of kona
fresh peaches -- + her husband + of the police van
airport autumn + someone on the river bank + sky in the sky + these october days
new year + fireworks + from the misty sky + smell of rain
tai chi + slicing the morning mist + the night in hand
orthopaedic clinic + the silence + our breaths out + in teaspoons
in the darkening yard + it has my hair + on the bedroom wall
into dusk + the silence + of snow geese + summer 's end
