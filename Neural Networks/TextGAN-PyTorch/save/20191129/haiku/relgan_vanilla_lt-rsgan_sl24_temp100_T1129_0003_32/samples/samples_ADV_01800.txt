ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of a buzzard
where dirty snow + meets heat + unexpected the church + he i trace the wind + new barber
farmwife 's marigolds + surging - + an old friends . . . the air + a sun tan
blowing for something + my light + an old house
a dull ache + settles deep + inside the last day
harvest moon -- + a fat toad + leaves the garden
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
waiting for the bus - + on the branch + at the end of the street + sunset
almost dawn -- - + a moth circles + between the same
along the pavement + snatches from the same + frost appears
into dusk + the same earth + waiting waiting
cafe for sale— + outdoor tables rusting + into the flickering grin
november autumn ; + the apple colder + in the shower
planting renovation + she buys new + colour contacts
obituary + the last whistle of something + as i turn another + to silence
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
all saints morning + . . . . + the unfamiliar path + a winter coat
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
waning moon + the way + you in the tree ... + a storm cloud
questions + purl like schools of fish + ... war memorial
despite + the foreclosure sign + daffodills
a ladder leans + for the fire truck bubble + into twilight
november afternoon -- + the mouse trap + snaps
early spring - + the heavy weight + in the car 's headlights
the sound of women + whispering - + moonless night + lays but
portage trail + voyageurs walked + i remember the day
hazy skies + the cedars less dark + after spring day
amid war + a blackbird tears flesh + from the cold night
some ago + my breaths bending + with rain
loosening + the top speaks of the + first gone
a sea + inside the bright breeze + in the cold spring day + new moon
spring tea— + through bone china + summer rain
