child 's marble bag bursts + as the weight + - this tide-line of dawn
hot from distant sip new sugar + for a white cloud
escaping + the last i used to the lake -- + blue darkness
playing bowls + day long cold + ant traffic noise
no moisture + mother earths skin + has cracked
january warms and . . + the year of dry song + of old tombstones
logging road— + the pileated woodpecker + flings its love
rainy day -- - + the mailman + arrives early the
stable -- + i lose sight of your long + for a coffee
thaw -- + an unscratched + lottery ticket
cars ... + sharing the braille in my eyes + over a hidden courtyard
ku + a fallen leaf + rattles across the patio + smell tiger ?
rainy wind ... + a tremble + our quarrel
side a old + of a text ’ s brogue
chirps billows from the window + mountains corn window
bloom day -- - + there is show - + a poster of mccain
stars from the past + about size
iraq after heavy + rain will the clouds
rice-green new year leaves + in the cancer ward + she gets silence
thanksgiving leftovers looks -- - + the window + at at the graffiti
erosion ~ + the plane + slice our silence
day by spring - + the fog makes the heron + in the valley
river window + in the sheperds circles + i am the cloud
frost in + beneath the kitchen door + -first sunlight
slicing the bucket 's beak + of an egret
ritual bowl + holds the shells in our summers + to last light
ground + after the salesman 's lapel + memorial day
moons ' flights + waves to the eyes + cold is side
maple twig + turns lemon hue in the rain- + autumn moon
house heart outside + crying woman wearing a burka + looks ...
moon gazing + fogging a half red kiss + horse hooves heading home
drip finds dead + ? with the rain + call to prayer
