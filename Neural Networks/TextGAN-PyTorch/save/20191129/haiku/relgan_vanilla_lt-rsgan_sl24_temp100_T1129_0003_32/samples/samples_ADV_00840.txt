my own pace -- + tiny flower blooms + from the last of dry
just friends — + the taste of summer + in the rain
maple twig + night from the + sunshine + of sky again
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
almost dawn + with the returning geese + an egret 's slow + summer haze
at the lawn concert + lighting the spent + in the bottom of the well + begin
waiting for + an old temple bell + having high with the light + a rainbow
mother spring + the tea leaves + with the early morning + her thin on her eyes + to the old
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the last page + in the wind
a sudden chill -- + autumn + sunshine the windows + new moon
june + pushing by the roses + blooming + for the front wheel ... + a yellow rose
as my train , + the cry of the mourning + perfect shave
cricket in the fog -- + a faint essence + of snow
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
mixed winter rain + fading monutains + grey in grey + cold autumn rain
cloudless night + a distant leaves + a bunch of daffodils + over the emptiness
autumn equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold + summer rain
the tip of + an old laughter + on the bottle ’ s wings + the dark ' thin
fall morning + a hawk 's reflection glides + across the puddle
rivulets + between the friend + on the sidewalk cafe + half moon
smell of her + learning nothing + on the train pond + smell by rain + a night 's pillow
shaving + new names + the moon + from its last night + the harvest moon
harvest moon + a sound of women + pounding rice
from under the dock + the wind + on the pine
long ago + with the leaves + blae butteries
day + from the pulp of snow + the first garden + spring in the hand
the soft patter + the honey + inside me -- - + my cold is full moon + a winter coat cart
stonehenge— + the silence + in the empty storm + empty garden
first firefly ... + still on the roof + the morning + of his train window
one by one + fireflies escape from + my name called + a dozen roses
on the hill + i peel a onion + in running water in bloom
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the parking lamp -
