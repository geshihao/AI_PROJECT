in the sky + the silence + our rain + a baby studies + the spring in the spring
whiskey winter -- + the search + on the car 's headlights + a rose
winter solstice + candle too short + for us night
cold rain + a bunch of daffodils + against the brick wall + fingers the field
wind chime + the first breeze + in the new funeral
from under the call + of the navel + of the autumn wind
cold snap + a quiet room + by my feet around my eye + grows high ?
autumn chill + the rainbow appears + in the bottom of my purse + free day
tide pools + the silence + in the evening rain + a storm cloud
. . . . + remembering tonight - + spring the girl + against the brick wall + lengthening
splatting drops + a crows marked + by autumn rain
a day hides + a voluptuous woman + compares melons
morning mist + the tree i walk through + her butterfly net . . + a soldier 's mother ’ s day
midnight + the last ball + of the pond + smell of rain + puddles of gray
early spring + pallets of fertilizer + on the loading dock
a sudden chill -- + a beach on sharing earth + in the winter fog
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
autumn mist + the silence beyond + the streetlight
friday the cold + a wet maple leaf sticks + to the mattress
break up + to wet night in the fog + a winter moon + and what i do
year 's end + summer rain + in the cherry blossom snow + spring is here + a white butterfly
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer + to himself
august morning + the fog thick + at every moon + and what i do
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the parking 's left
waning moon + the cricket behind the fridge + starts singing + out of a street
powdering the dog + three women still + some passengers
rainy day -- + one playing + in the storm
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
questions + purl like schools of fish + a yellow butterfly + to the crime
a sudden chill -- + a bit + lost in flower + in the neighbor 's fog
frozen pond— + white antlers rise + through the cold ring + a lost kitten
