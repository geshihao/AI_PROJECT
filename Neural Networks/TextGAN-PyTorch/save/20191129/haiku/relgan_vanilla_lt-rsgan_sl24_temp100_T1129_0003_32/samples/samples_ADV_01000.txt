white roadside crosses + where the road + that of snow
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
autumn mist + where the shells + her hair
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
the ides + of a boy train new + of snow
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stars ... + spring .
november night + between our argument - + a young woman + sunset rain
half time + the sound of women + pounding rice
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the blue wave
tools rusting + unused on the work bench + a faucet dripping
on the pavement + the quiet of the sun in the darkness + my neighbors practice tai-chi + then the mountain
wind chime + my phone picks up + a wifi hotspot
midnight moon + filling up my window + black umbrellas + sold out
as i pass + the doctor schedules + a palm pond + summer 's full moon
blind date + her face half revealed + in moonlight
somewhere + in the buttercups + an empty laundromat + its flame almost out + white silence
shortest night + the butterfly + at the blue sky -- - + a carriage horse shits + as he passes me
on the pavement + between the honks + zealously
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
spring gale + raindrops on against the corn + between us
afternoon fog -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
the thanksgiving meal - + after eating the talk + slows down
into dusk + the night adds shadows + in the dark
emptied fountain + carried by the autumn + the scent of rain + fog fog
sunday morning + smells of french toast + empty new year + spill down
emptied fountain + carried by the wind + silt to dusk -- - + a half moon
just friends â€” + her child streatched on her lap + ... the same + ... the trees
a pagoda + in the wood of elder + he left behind her shadow + in the wind
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + across the sky
the quiet - + i keep recounting + how many santas
after an storm + the night separating from the red + the song in the wind , then + spring .
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a mother 's lips + pursing brightly
