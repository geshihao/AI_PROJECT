awoken at 4 am + her sunday dress + across the sky
almost dawn -- + i follow a snowflake + inside the sky
ants transport a moth + traffic what the hound - + do n't enters the taxi
at the lawn concert + lighting the spent + of the night 's end
drunk on the beach- + the in the grass + my cold night
moonbeams— + a clump of mushrooms + from the stars ...
almost dawn + the me from the heat + of her hair
a black woman + breastfeeding her infant— + a red flies home
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the company 's pillow
darkening trees + the steady shrilling + of cicadas
may dawn ... + the afternoon heart from the + first frost
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
long ago + i threw your letters away + footprints in the snow
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
autumn equinox + and a memory of sea + cicadas and sweet + on my very so cold night
calling to + street sparrows + at the mist filled the way + summer heat
first spring ... + a shooting star beneath + the wharf
abandoned farmhouse + a yellowed grocery list taped + for no `` parade ? '' + a white butterfly
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
quiet dawn- + the fog thick + at every window
hot september -- - + a dead bowl + of imported ale
the girl with the soul + of a text + april rain
sleety rain -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
autumn sunset -- + a smiling of the scent + of night too books
early spring + everything + dripping
early spring + everything + dripping
around where a dark -- + of hiroshima + winter rain
close lightning + the metallic taste + of too rain
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
a lake + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the sky
from under the dock + come the canada geese + summer rain
along the pavement + snatches of an ice + stifling in the fog
