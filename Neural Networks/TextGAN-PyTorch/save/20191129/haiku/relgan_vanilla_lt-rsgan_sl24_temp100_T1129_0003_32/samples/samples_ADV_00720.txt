nun and monk + read the crows + smell of rain
morning mist + the scent + of rain
city traffic - + she travels with + falling rain
neighbor day + she teaches her grandchild + on my glove
the glare off + between the leaves + from the wind
to the finland station + the king + of the seats
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a in law
honking through + and the rough stones + soak up the scent + of a water ...
endless rain + is brittle the leaves + underfoot the crumbling leaves + underfoot
subway transfer + the silence + of falling
crescent moon + just one more + for her back summer + a candle flutters
on last day + the that of the lawn + he we a winter moon + to the old pond
summer evening + finding an old flame + on facebook
sleety rain + fallen on bare earth + evening rain
fog + a few spots + in the blossom + and the sky
midnight rain + finally he comes out + as the silence
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- + in the wind
the rail tracks + in the empty motel + the old oak + in old tea , in full
the maple leaf + rattles across + the passengers -- + my husband in his razor
midnight + the silence beyond + the firework smoke + their wedding
on the island + and warm your smile + without shepherd + on the night 's last
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
with sunlight + mist trailing + over the blue sky + over the lie
midnight + all day long + broken promises + summer rain
trains approaching + the + forest of darkness + at the light in the sky
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + one to the kitchen
tools rusting + unused of the panzer + just one
blue new moon + the silence beyond + left down the night + new september fog
december stillness - + spring the feet + of a damselfly + kite festival
january morning + a faint breeze + at the end + a white moth + the heat skin
new year + fireworks + the trail of a long + on the pond
