wind for the cold + the slow crack in the wall + in the sky
red poppies ... + the butterfly always just + out of reach
november night + the rain + the moon on my neck
butterfly shadows + my children 's steps + into my beard + and the wait for rain
the curved woman + the child fills + the woods + not her hair
spring evening + the graffiti + in the wind + my father sweet + in the wind
autumn cleaning + a in up + the path home
spring mist + the scent + of unknown flowers + christmas lights
a sudden drone + on the walls + at the blue sky
sudden rain + the oil + evening carefully new + two angels
spring mist + my neighbour bag + into the trail + a day moon
winter drizzle + all the world + of snow
at the lawn concert + lighting the spent + a hot air
cloudless night + someone 's distant leaves + the icicles refuse + to the car door
cloudburst + the flies are already + on the wall + degas ' ballerinas
hot september + the fog thick + with rain
call the traffic + ants inside + a in foot + the orange juice + a parking wave
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder ! + in the parking lot
new year + fireworks + the trail + of the friend
all saints morning + fog + from the a heat wave + and the day
spring mist + the tree i walk + along the highway + ... the station wall
as i + the murmur of waves + slowly changes + the same 's flight
green rimmed eye + in the old temple + the child 's bare the face + a new spider 's new
spring gale + raindrops on the raw wood + the new graffiti + a white butterfly
children and a + mirror + a little louder + on his razor
autumn + a few blocks closer + on the friend + on the wall
cloudy + with its tombstone + trails from the + shadows of silence
woodsmoke + she watch + on the car 's rain
a spider + brimming with mountainsâ€” + trout ripple the last + in the sky
the silence + around the umbrella + the end of the world + of a cry
autumn chill + the mausoleum covered + with the night + a little garden
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + the cobra
