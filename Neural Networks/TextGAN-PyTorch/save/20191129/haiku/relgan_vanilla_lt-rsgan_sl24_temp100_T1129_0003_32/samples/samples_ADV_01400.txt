last light + his fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold + under foot
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + across the sky
. lace and . . + slowly my pockets full + can among the sunrise
a street artist + soon finished + the autumn spring snow
when celsius + candle lost up + from the last summer heat + a winter rain
wildfire haze + an empty mind + at the clouds
dawn -- - + a homeless man + on the wall
more piercing + in the empty + changes au lait spliff + her thoughts
my father 's hammer + warm again + an empty candle 's name
a sudden chill -- + stars obscured + by autumn rain
between doses + of cough medicine + silence in the breeze
cold news + someone honks + an old pond -- growing dim + to the same direction
the empty house + and i slow down + near the jasmine bush
open window + the silence beyond the loon + a rose
tired new mom - + brown leaves + falling from the green trees
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter berries
looking for something + in the empty motel + the moon
the best lies + have the fewest details + after rain
as i pass her boyfriend - + white wind ... + father is the morning light
full moon - + the sound of a distant grass + a single magpie
meditating + all watch the clock + into autumn wind
overcast day + a wet maple leaf sticks + to the mattress
frozen pondâ€” + a tiny lizard + riot
a girl with the clock + with the clock 's + of her sunday dress
steady rain + the muscles in my back + unknot
almost dawn + by the small black hair + on the last streetlight + our last summer night
between doses + of cough medicine + silence in the air
death of a moment + the gull of + passing in snow + that of the night river
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly + field of rain
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + no clouds
labor afternoon -- + my stars shine + in your kiss
our shadows + but the bare trees + from the tree
