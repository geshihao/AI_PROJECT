where dirty snow + meets road salt + a dozen roses
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
amid war + a snail crawls up to autumn leaves -- - + war cenotaph
— + candles line to war days + another old eyes -- - + in the old life
all her hair + brushed with moonlight ... + forty years ago
moonbeams— + a clump of mushrooms + where the wrong 's + someone no one by one
crystal night + outside + the stars shine
up in the sky -- - + i order my eggs + sunny morning and -
darkening trees - + all the blustery colours + ... homeless ...
dusty knickknacks + i try to recall + a scent of honey
gloomy afternoon -- - + i did + the crescent 's flight -- - + autumn sunset
slice by slice + in the buttercups + on the rose bush -- + slow soaking
late winter snow -- - + my neighbor brushing her hair + to the same page
early spring + a tired + of wild house
paddling - + cormorants ' flights + waves lapping
almost home + pausing by the pond + a day moon
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
gibbous moon -- + she tells the holes bluer -- + winter rain
full summer -- + yellow leaves among + in the laurel
as i half + fluttering in the dog : + deep immobile
i rush to buy + her birthday present + on the pane
billboards come -- + her perfect + to the car iris
twilight -- + this graffiti + on the blue moon
spring mist + my neighbour asks + in moonlight
first firefly - + she leaves circle + between the headlights
early spring + everything + dripping
night after + in the sheperds eyes + a day moon
quiet stable ... + a film of salt forms + on the bedroom wall
new year winter - + at the sidewalk cafe + half by my coast
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
haiku potato chips + nobody can write + just one
calling to + street sparrows + at the mist -- - + a poster of rain
