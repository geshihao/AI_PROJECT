leaving home + the tea leaves + rainy night
deep silence + the orphaned nestlings + this third morning
early spring -- + one chickadee + louder than the rest + leans to another
snowstorm— + another poem + too wordy
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
new year + a warm morning + on the christmas ornaments
gentle breaths -- + she shuts i stand under + her braids
gazing after + the poor woman 's axe + gleams brightly
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for new teacup
her piano-playing + comes morning + from an empty house
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the sparrow
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the teabag
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
paddling slowly + i already in the world + kept by a bookmark
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
alongside time - + smell coffee from house + through the north
after the storm + somewhere during its echo + a butterfly 's day
wedding anniversary -- + a winter moon + in the sky
ripened tomatoes— + the moon - + rises me
wave from news + along the riverside + ... he hauds up her lung x-ray
leaden potato chips + nobody can write + just one by one
martin luther king + of the fence + those watch the wedding ring + of my computer
guid friday - + cruciform a maw snuves + athort the lift
leaves potato chips + nobody can write + just one by one
independence day— + i let him touch + the same yard light
eaves + pulling sound + from the first earth landing + six feet not
almost dawn + the fog thick + at every window
my daughter starts college -- + another empty + pint of beer
moonrise + the columbine still + swinging
keep an eye open + a winter moon + on the rose bed
late winter rain + fading melting + on the salt air
desert cemetery- + she leaves her good intentions + in her hymnal
