you out + as the white sound + of autumn rain
scattered wind + fragments of conversation + drift from the sea breeze
ursa major + a puddle filled + out of reach
between the drone + of lawnmowers + a scent of rain
hot beach sand + between two trains + on the green grass
music + after many power night + midnight
empty day + we collected for her— + high tide
valentine 's day + a patch of + in the headlights
crystalline sky -- - + a cobra escapes from + the bronx zoo
basketball stops + on the step + of soft rain
awoken at 4 am + to here her death + on the light
as i walk - + colorful tents + cup of tea
open window + the sound of a horse galloping + through leaves
portage trail + voyageurs walked + i remember the roof
valentine 's day + only rain + on the scarecrow
indian summer + he comes out + as darkness
early spring + everything + dripping
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of sunset
one small step + to the cooling tower + sunrise
morning radio news + a blackbird tears flesh + from a ripe cherry
early spring + fog resting on cedars + cup of kona
to my smartphone + mount fuji in the sunset + after spring . again . . .
keep melting + with the returning geese + but the rainy season -- - + autumn rain
mountain storm + the tree i walk through + her butterfly net
summer evening - + oak branches fracture + a falling 's kiss
war news + the comfort + of crows together
an old lady called mary + her child streatched on her lap , + sitting hour
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
daylight fades -- + the fog lifts + in the sand
stars at dusk + a spray of willow buds + by my gate to the weight + a hot
wildfire haze + an empty laundromat + of an old man
all her day -- - + the sound of a woodpecker + shifts again
