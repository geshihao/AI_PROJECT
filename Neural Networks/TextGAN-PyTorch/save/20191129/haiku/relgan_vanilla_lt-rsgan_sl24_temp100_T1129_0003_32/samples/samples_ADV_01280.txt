march winds the boy sky + the rain has the moon + and no one
rivulets + a breeze stirs the spent petals + with no one geese
almost dawn + the night separating from the + of an old photo
that spring + painting the fence + a street dog sniffs + my shadow
oh spring snow + the silence + of the night air
tai chi -- - + an empty laundromat + at the light
spring mist + i let the requiem + begin
the debt ceiling will rise -- + a smiling of the daffodils + sunset
more piercing + on the other end + a blackbird tune from the city window + from the cool 's chill
after heavy + her light off + the graffiti + on wall street
icy conditions - + another slide + on wall street
. . . + the undercurrent + in her voice
morning haze ... + a few dewdrops on + the morning on his pass + a grows high grass
sundown station - + butt prints + on the seats
the blank page + with a smile + of the cherry blossom
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine of snow
the rail tracks + toward a harvest moon + thoughts on the garden
in the darkening yard + the child drowned + papyri in the wind
sunday morning - + after a noon + another universe
doing up - + the quiet ritual + of smoke
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus breaks + summer tea
shaking out crumbs + a cormorant + on wall street
desert twilight -- + the warmth + of the lupine leaves fallen + on the bedroom wall
from under the dock + come the canada geese + the same bedtime
mixed and rain- + stirring extra sugar + summer rain
unknotting + the hammock ropes + his brush
central park + painting + still inviting roof on the train + the station wall
frozen pondâ€” + white antlers rise + through falling leaves
fireworks show his be + my wife begins + in the stars
october embrace + a faint essence + of mothballs
upstairs , swathed + in neon , + the winter moon
between the yoga + of the april escape + the old man + after the rain
