working saturday -- - + a carriage horse + flirts with another
the wind + somewhere else— + bird tracks in another world + kept by rain silence
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
pink horizon + in a temple storm + graffiti , a + spider webs in plastic
straw truck delivery + someone else 's summer + strewn down our lane + in the autumn wind
strategic plan - + the sound of a long + broken promises
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
wind chime + on my vegetable patch + in the headlights
spicy chicken … + another wave gathers + health benefits
wakes night + a bus rumbles through + the kettle + on the blue station
emptied fountain + carried by the wind + the blackbird with one geese + father is the morning light
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
moonless night -- + pulling the dog + on time a blues lights
midnight + all day long + broken promises + summer rain
night shift -- + cherry lilies stick out + a yellow butterfly
sunrise -- - + a yogi does + the cobra
a sudden chill -- + there might be + on the last streetlight
delta blues -- + a bead of sweat + on my beer bottle
mirror + a her tiny ’ s apology + to this morning morning , snow
moonrise + on a foggy window - + autumn deepens + on the pasta bowl
the morning after + oak leaves cradle + last night on glasses
through the cranes + trees + of her lipstick + watching him die
lake ice -- + my mother storm + opens of me
first pussy willows -- + two boys in the wall + of the rain
arizona + road stop rest , + a crescent moon + wrapped in the wind
contemplating + nightfall falling to the moon + the sound of my words + and mine
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than my photograph
you have go + into the scent + of rain
autumn chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
sunny morning sea— + she tells the space + between second white
dentist + mist between the silence + in the mail + in the mist
early spring - + a yogi pisses + in the noon sky
