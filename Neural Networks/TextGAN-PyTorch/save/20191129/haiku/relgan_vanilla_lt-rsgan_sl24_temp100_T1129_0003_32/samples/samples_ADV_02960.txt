new year + fireworks + in the misty sky
independence day— + i let him touch + the blue iris
overcast day + another just 's + cemetery
wedding anniversary -- + green leaves the mountains + in the car 's name
on the hill + i trace my toe 's + day after day
deep fog -- + kerry concedes + the election
. -- + my husband starts snoring + again without
market - + my silence + our silence
empty room ... + a distant grass + summer rain
black friday + smell of your feet + in the mirror
. -- + a few leaves flutter + to through the wind
how some things end— + onion flakes + on the market sack
even and go + ruins of the bridge + linked silence
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat
all saints morning + the path of a moth + turns to the deep silence
lulled + to the bell + just out the speaker + end of reach
morning haze -- - + the nude beach + at the park
early spring + pallets of fertilizer + on the loading dock
moonless night -- + pulling the dog + on the seeds
nude beach + about size + and sighs
twilight -- - + a gm car + needs a push
almost dawn + the fog thick + at every window
broken easel— + the front yard + a fish i calls + to the autumn wind
half-light + each for , a train + the end of the train -- + a shells of crickets
reading summer rain + close between the sound of + a heat , snow
desert wind- + my mother 's i + has cracked
half of the rain + almost empty + winter rain
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
late winter , s end - + my skin gives smell + after rain
around where my palm + we touch + their wedding light
frozen pond— + white antlers rise + through the ice .
endless winter rain + my umbrella + on the fallen pears
