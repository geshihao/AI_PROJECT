a room + the white barn + the old apple tree + on the rose
to the end + of the sunrise + a light in the darkness + between us
winter night + the what i let the phone + hard rain
gone + the rain + at the pond
desire + the honey + inside the old temple + again moon
new year + fireworks + the trail of the leaves + on the rose bed
the last rose + the cut marks + on the rose
hot -- + the i woman + in the wind
dawn + the fog thick + over the lie
new year + the calicantus morning + the morning + at the sunrise
autumn equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on the fire
as the night + a stone into the pond + sprinklings of moon
to the river wind + the echo of a cuckoo + the winter rain
moonless night + the cyclist + without lights + this godless way trees
hot beach sand + tree slowly leave + the cemetery 's warm
to the finland station + the king of hearts + the night garden + the slow tick
dark days + another me + at the halal louder
the underside + of lawnmowers + the last 's day + the day 's last
autumn mist + the tree i take + into the ground + a rainbow
a tiny world + unfolds and thrives - + hot rain
woodsmoke in my tea gets + left unopenedâ€” + summer rain
scattering + the faint scent + of rain
with sunlight + filling up my window + two well placed + till the silence
first firefly + a her hair + in the wind + the sky
morning + the murmur of waves + slowly changes a + blue fingers
the crunch + of the scent + of rain
ring around + a white moth circles + through the ice
the courtship songs + a fence post + and i on the death bed + a winter rain
spring + the landscape coming + to an old house + after the shower
the underside + of lawnmowers + the silence + of the sky
cold snap + not sharing + cherry petals + and a slow day
