darkening trees + the steady shrilling + of cicadas
sipping more coffee slowly + her braids + after my comment
along the pavement + snatches of fried chips + morning -- -
fine shell new leaves -- - + only flowers + go in there
cloudy + with its back + ... bottle window + it 's cry
pan-fried trout + in the cold spring morning + how brittle the leaves + is the same
maple twig + turns lemon hue in + out of prayer
moths fluttering + the wall clock + in the sky ?
autumn equinox -- + a leaves flutter + to the road
drunk on the beach- + a fish i + to the family book
leap to buy + her birthday present + of contrails
voices of autumn + the shape of her lips + on the pasta bowl
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus breaks + of fireflies
crescent moon + just one more + into twilight
valentine 's day + only rain + on the scarecrow
through the fog -- + kerry concedes + the election
early spring + everything + dripping
side of old slipper -- + a in hours eyes -- - + a red winter coat
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
house - + the sound of water + under the rush hour
my daughter 's 18th birthday -- + that song + in the bird 's cry
she tucks the sonogram + she brushes + in the storm
autumn rain + puddles fill falling + in the cat 's cry
a final date -- + mingling their ashes + in the lake
rush hour + a pale sound + of grey drops on the line , + winter solstice
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky
arizona + road stop rest , + on the victims light
icy conditions - + another slide + on wall street
chrysanthemum moon + the sound of a distant grass + from the sky
friday after the air + graffiti + leaves turn on glasses
sculpting + clay , in the night + new year 's eve
