the sound + of the first fallen leaf + this is empty + first light in the valley
early spring + everything + dripping
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
porch swing + now and then + on the breeze
summer solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
enlightment -- + a police car + on fire
the courtship -- - + he tunes + his guitar
away from eyes -- - + a line of red + - motionless
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
an old temple + amongst cedar trees + too slow to point stars
may dawn -- - + as leaves together + to study the menu
typhoon passed -- + one watering can + in the sandbox
blue moon -- + never 's warmth + of your lips
fine shell new + with its women smile + on the red wine stain
pension plans + the slow drone of a plane + coming to land
bight of the fence + a constellation of willow + on asphalt
frozen pondâ€” + white antlers rise + through the ice .
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
year 's end + of afternoon tea , + and shoes
on the hill + half a mirror showing + in the last rain
flu season -- + to kiss + or another lie
indian summer - + bees ' + a long line of the to sun + to the smoke wisp
rice-green pond -- + all that . . . + a yellow card + declined
buckets set up + beside the bed + a flock of stars
into dusk + the rain + in falling from the wind , dusk + a heat field
coffee rings + with my fingers + the my christmas tree + one by my father 's grave
summer rain + mixed with silver hair + steps on the asphalt
early spring + everything + dripping
darkening trees - + a flight of parakeets + brightly lit
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
