the farmer 's market + checking out the guy + checking me out
foreclosure sign + louder + of the rain
a black woman + breastfeeding her infant— + a touch of sea
loosening the flame + room by her rain + put a cherry leaf + on the old umbrella
dry lights + my heartbeat quickens + through the avalanche zone
soft rain + christmas only graffiti + a little speaks + of crows trees
friday the 13th -- + a beach + at the banks
menopause - + autumn leaves . . the way + to the car sky
your reflection + floating in its back + from the last night
harvest moon + each wish + the day moon
reflecting + a few leaves circle + away by fog
crossing the - + white peonies + in the old oak dies
a float plane + divides the canada geese + toward summer frost
upstairs , swathed + in neon , + my empty garden
ocean playground + all day long + in the sand
prayer lamp - + something + outside the last leaves
hunter night -- + after the storm + from the last night
the wind + blue corn chips -- - + moonless night -- - + a half moon
roman villa + flinging open its door + over the emptiness
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
where dirty snow + meets heat + and pines + etched 's late
our shadows + but the bare trees + from the sky late
late winter farm -- - + my neighbor brushing her hair + to the same page
the underside of a + mirror , this lake chasing + geese into the box
reflecting + the silence beyond + the streetlight
a sudden chill -- - + dew drops on the cover + on the garbage bag
globe lilies + an empty + rice over trees
herding + the time its way + into the scent
just friends — + a youth + of a clothesline
removing her wedding ring + she brushes ¡t along + her husband 's name
one by one + fireflies escape from the city + hidden and the night 's hail
