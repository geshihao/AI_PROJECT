geriatric ward + the bluebird 's call + clearly audible
the sunset -- - + after my bath a dead friend + in my tea
barn at dusk + a carriage horse shits + as he passes me
short night - + yellow windows + its forever out
pranayama— + the candle + still falling
daylight fades + the bean vines climb + the long road
march rain + puddles fill up + smell green
east river nice day + i look at the lawn -- - + a poster of mccain
a final date + close by the sound of autumn + under foot
winter greys -- + seabirds string + between pier lights
sunny sky + another company seeds leaves + from the spruce stood
late winter snow + the strands of fills with rain + on my rooftiles
traffic jam - + finally the sky + brightens the night
the space + between etched names ... + war cenotaph
no escaping + another star + between the red berries
cold rain + the greengrocer stacks cabbages + again
dust motes + my dna + in autumn light
waiting for the bus - + all the sunset + one by one
invasive species + just one sugar cube + with the sweet peas
late summer + the bean vines climb + the long road
last light of + the laborer + at sundown
stars road— the dream + from the scent of rain
early morning dew -- + her leaves the last + in her hair
summer 's end + the tenderness + of light
orthopaedic clinic + the three-legged 's flight + with my mind
gibbous moon + the smell of hot gumbo + floats on
endless morning + smells of french toast + another old tune
a clear sky -- - + my neighbor 's wife + on the window
as old as i feel + on the stadium
early spring + everything shape + smiles from the day
cedar bus stop + another friend in my shadow + also changes
young lovers + the honking in the hands -- - + second day
