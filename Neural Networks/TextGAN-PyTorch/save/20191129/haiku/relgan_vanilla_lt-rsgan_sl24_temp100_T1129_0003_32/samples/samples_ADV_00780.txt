into dusk + the dog 's sharp world + on the branch + new address
the sudden patter + of many campfires + in my old temple + summer 's end
midnight night -- + a patch of the + field of snow
an old lady called + into the quarter + & through the child 's bare north + hand to lost
harsh sunlight + faces peep the bars + the autumn wind + that will end of reach
subway transfer + the homeless lady + sells mirrors
spring mist + the sun in the wind + the spring night in the + first frost
new year + fireworks + the first time + smell of rain
the rill 's trick + a greenfinch moves + its green around
ursa major + a white barn with the fence + the shadow
blue sea + and warm air merge + fog horns
your reflection + floating + on the subway rain
mixed precipitation -- -- + a flat finish + on fire
indian summer + the sweeping + the same earth + waiting waiting
somewhere + two well walks its echo + a butterfly flitting
laundry day + the agonized roars + as the old oak + to the old oak dies
naked + at dawn . . . + the fallen leaf + this summer night
autumn seabreeze ... + my heartbeat quickens + through the avalanche zone + a white butterfly
call the traffic + a white barn + inside the breeze , + new summer 's mist
late winter rain + the anniversary + of a train
what thing cries + on the path to + i warm deep a for it : + wind-puffed primroses
mountain storm + the sudden force + of horse piss
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a in law
invasive species + the scarecrow + almost empty + a bee egg + and winter
into dusk + the way + lifting fog + are slow bright day + a white butterfly
leafless maple + close + near the floating + down the mountain
summer solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
full summer -- + yellow leaves drift + in the laurel
awoken at 4 am + to the honking + for the fire
the brush + is dipped deeper + on the cold spring day
harvest moon + the bigger + in the old window + autumn rain
winter stars . . . + the darkness + between your mountains and . . + winter rain
