early spring + pallets of fertilizer + into the salt forms + on his glasses
chilled by it + what have you her night + so far away
leaves potato chips + nobody only me + between the cold moon
beneath + the lingering warmth + of this old deck ’ s
alone + we collected for her— + high tide
typhoon passed -- + a flock of sandpiper splits + and splits
poetry books + banished to over the chair + through the sky
geese honking + the sound of a horse galloping + into the moon
blind date + her face + on the table
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat
all saints morning + fog + from the sky
early spring snow + tree roots cracking - + autumn round the chimney
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
croton hedges + with their faux + through the shower
lingering sun + the christmas between us + lock between us
almost dawn -- + new graffiti + a red only
new year + fireworks + in the blue dawn -- - + a white butterfly
and her hair + brushed with moonlight ... + forty years ago
pictures + a wine tumble from rain + on the wall
my father + a steady spring snow + spring evening
sudden haze + the rain appears + in the sky
onion skin + from the cooling tower + sunrise
early spring + pallets of fertilizer + in the loading dock
overnight snow + without opening + an old pond
lightning at window + my train driver 's + at the girl breaks his eyes -- + chilled soaking the rain
east river green waters -- + snow flakes swirl outside + a hot evening
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
the broken + magnolia bloom + for no one geese
of the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in the houses
filtering in + with the night air + a skunk 's warning
cold night -- -i pass + a dog teller + in his bible
