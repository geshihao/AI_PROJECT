cool breeze + someone honks when + a winter moon + to i 'll never bare trees + winter dusk
beneath + the window buddha + on the window
sunny winter + to a dead key + on the scarecrow
the stars + the landscape coming + to the young monk + in the lftover ’ s
at the hotel + plugging in the wind + the path home
my father + the haiku + an apple + just one more + one last
another birthday— + watching the long ash + on the incense
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the last + changes lit stops
harvest moon + the bigger pumpkin + waits for a ship ’ s apology + the weight
sculpting + clay , + the spring between us + new a rain
an orange and pink sky + the last of the scent + of in the wind
november sky -- + that song + rain and trees
the page-finders + of a fence post + almost a dove + autumn rain
twilight + with the moon + not quite full + but full a + at sea
my daily bread + on the empty couch + scratch of moon
clear sky + the silence + in the mail + the apple lights + in the roses
autumn mist + the tree i take + into the scent + of the easter lily
new year + yellow elders left + on the rose bush -- + in the wind
from under the call + from the son + a walk interrupted + in the cherry grass
rivulets + the same + of the friend + the rain
sculpting + clay , + the potter sunlight + empty vase
just friends — + for the clouds + my empty garden fence + wander the city stars
sunshine + the hawk + in the sky and sky + on the last leaves
manhattan afternoon haze + the moon + on the hot wind
desert rush + the same earth + waiting waiting + on the pine
first firefly ... + a few still a essence + of old voice
road closed + moose tracks continue + on the christmas
my daughter 's 18th birthday -- + that song + for rain
wind chime + the tree i + almost touch + a white butterfly
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
summer rain + finally he comes clean + about the mountain + an empty day
an orange + in the sky + first light in the tree + a white butterfly
