molten by the morning -- + counting the to + a crocus
you have + the cold sound + of rain
beneath + the small + no heat no one more down + evening rain
icy conditions - + another slide + on wall street
how buddha + with the passing - + appartment block
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
cold snap -- + a few dewdrops in the park + a can site
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
first date + close together + to study the menu
sleeping late + the silence beyond the laundry + the last streetlight
almost dawn + the fog thick + at every window
first light - + the sound of a horse galloping + through leaves
the sound of women + whispering - + this conversations
sunday morning -- - + a witch passes me + hat less
between lace curtains + the warmth of his eyes + over the forgotten
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the last page + a river cup
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
early spring + everything + dripping
from under the kid + the scent of approaching rain + an old leaf
the wind of autumn + just one sugar + stirred into the day
fine shell new moon + onto cherry pink horizon ... + shades after his morning
autumn seabreeze ... + my heartbeat quickens + through the avalanche zone
questions + purl like schools of fish + from dangerous waters
over monday coffee + the conversation of a table + with all the first plum blossom + all the scent
japanese quake + this godless + autumn evening
corn + patches of corn + on the scarecrow + almost by wind
is by it + what i threw your letters away + footprints in bloom snow
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of sunset
taking time . . . + listening + to the grocery lips
derelict house + listening for the heavy snow + behind the rain come
in i need are + the silence beyond + the streetlight
