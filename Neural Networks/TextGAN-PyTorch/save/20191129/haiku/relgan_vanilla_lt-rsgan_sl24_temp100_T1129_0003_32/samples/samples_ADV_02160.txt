another button - + an soft silence + is thoughts
rush hour + she stirs more honey + on the cold spring
+ an ant in the sunflowers -- + afraid + to turn another page
dusty knickknacks + at twilight -- - + no sunset this year
between the drone + of lawnmowers + a scent of rain + from the aerials
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
long blue tail + of my keys + in the wind
standing stock-still : + a mudspattered + in the car 's fresh air
sleepless night - + the whistle of a distant + first child 's a heat
amid war + seem to water + among the garden + a fish i lost + after his razor
you have gone away + the winter stars + suddenly white colour + his empty garden
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + outside the stars
morning haze -- - + i keep recounting + how many santas
steady rain -- + one last + with no one
news from up + the what change of + a day moon
his shadow + through circles + the night garden
twilight -- - + i check out + a wait for sale sunset + to day after day
storm -- + my walking stick pierces + crusted snow -- -
almost dawn -- - + a dead bowl + of imported ale
finally morning + a few blocks closer + than yesterday
not in the yard + between our argument - + summer rain
barn owl â€™ s cry : + wind-puffed bumps + in the cul-de-sac
at the hotel fog + someone of the sunrise + the last rose
slipping in + beneath the kitchen door + -first sunlight
another button + lost along the way + lifting fog
from under the dock + come the canada geese + summer rain
taking time . . . + listening + to the grocery clerk
rabbit morning -- - + a line of red + on the wall
listening + to an incense stick + used to the old house
spring mist + the tree i walk through + her needle -- - + out of a bath towel
harvest moon -- + the sound of a woodpecker + slowly in the paper lantern ?
early spring + everything + dripping
