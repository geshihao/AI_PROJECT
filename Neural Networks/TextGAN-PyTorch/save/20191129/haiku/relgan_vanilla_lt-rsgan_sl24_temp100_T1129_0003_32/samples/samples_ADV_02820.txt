' night -- + the cloud of a fence post + almost white
year-end bank statement + reusing my fingers + a cigarette butt
early spring + pallets of fertilizer + outside the light signal
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stream
how some things end— + onion flakes + in the market sack
snowstorm— + another poem + too wordy
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror
failed copy + for the heat + left out from the speaker
at the hill + half a mirror showing + a quarter room
a in child + the distinctive cry + in his death
windy day -- - + homeless man + wears a new garbage bag + pray my buy
between doses + of cough medicine + silence
away day - + putting some salt + faded harvest
a butterfly - + between gorse sky + on the end of reach
morning haze + from the cherry trees + on the ultrasound
early spring - + snow comes in + with the bird 's song
tools rusting + unused on the work bench + a faucet dripping
the sound + of a faded flag + with rainbows
past midnight + from the last of + new summer dreams + scatter clear
storm -- + his tiny card + declined
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
calling to work + some passengers + speak ...
fading light + tree roots cracking + an empty candle 's day + her braids
indian summer -- + a mosquito above + a christmas heaven
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the cold rain
halloween pumpkin + an old temple + rest into + for rain
raking the leaves ~ + wind blows + on the end of the sea
spring storm— + a small bowl + of imported ale
late winter winter -- - + homeless man stands + by ice cream truck
croton hedges + with one step + their wedding light
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
dying afternoon light -- - + a couple stop + to kiss
