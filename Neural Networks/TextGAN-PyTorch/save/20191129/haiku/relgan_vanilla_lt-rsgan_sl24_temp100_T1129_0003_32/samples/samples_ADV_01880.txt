starless night -- + my favorite pub loses + above the green trees
twenty four seven + dark mirror + ...
cool breeze + blowing dandelions + in circles in the sand + a little house
a spider 's sale + pierces the heat + into the breeze + of afternoon
despite + in the forest of fog + and a wait leaf + a day moon
late winter rain + the greengrocer stacks cabbages + on cabbages
customs ' declaration - + determining the value + of new haiku
drip honking + an elixir of cherry blossoms + in the wind
the sound + of the first fallen leaf + in the forgotten birds -- + scent of damp earth
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
hot august wind -- + even the hum + of a computer keyboard + midnight solitude
hot september -- - + a flat chested woman + enters the wrong rest room
almost dawn + the fog thick + at every old temple window
red calls come and go + but the same people + drinks at bar
spicy chicken â€¦ + another wave gathers + health benefits
starless night -- + my favorite pub loses + above the drop
all saints morning + the path + of trodden leaves
all that finger + raised in greeting + an empty garden + drinks in the autumn wind
four am ~ + across now + the bee hive
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
obituary + the trail dissolves + into wildflowers + falling rain
mixed precipitation -- -- + a flat finish + on fire
knitting + my neighbour asks + in the hands -- - - + a daughter drawing the pierces + to summer stars
cold snap -- + a few leaves flutter + on the road
blind date + her face + on the cold moon
an old temple + amongst cedar trees + too slow to point stars
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
hillside thunder + barely a water at window + fishing line in the wind , over + my cup
february first -- + her husband + at the bottle + graffiti
troubled sleep -- + an old stories get towards + to the light
cloudy sky + after the eclipse + she 'll read the rain + over the night
memory care unit + snowflakes melting + one by one
