almost dawn + the fog thick + at every moon
between lace curtains + and morning + a can and then + summer tea moon
fine shell + almost a dead friend + the tip of my thoughts + at the roses
a sudden chill -- + a late-night + visitor
waning moon + the cricket behind her + to moth good night
corn + on the branch + for food , gas and ten-year-old - + a poster of rain
cold snap -- + the junkyard dog + heavy chain
late winter solstice + candle too short + this winter night
after each haiku— + the pencil + a little shorter
far from wall street + a cormorant + dives
gone + the same earth + waiting waiting
cold snap + all watch the rising + checking out the window
dew + lifting + in the wind , then the space + a white toilet
almost dawn + the night separating from the day + a crescent moon
late winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
no work today + her husband complains again + on the streets
just friends — + her child streatched on her lap + ... war memorial
september 11th + steady slow soft snow + this is full
all saints morning + i watch the rising + of an empty house
cloudy + a faint essence + of heels ... + earth day
hot chocolate + the sound of a heat + this morning in snow
sunrise -- - + the long line + the smell of snow + on my hair
one by one + fireflies escape from + the convict 's pencil + hard rain
no work today + her husband complains again + of coon tracks
my son 's birthday + the rabbit hops + across the road
desert mountains . . . + and her hair + in the wind
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
almost dawn + the night separating from the + somewhere still in the bay . . . + her summer night
spring breeze + in the winter + reading the night 's + light of snow
midnight + with its grey + summer rain
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
confucius + another long path + to deep silence
