morning fog -- + a nasturtium burns + the tip of my thoughts
may dawn -- + snow on the day + a bird 's woman
chrysanthamums + the fog looks up + a dragged crisis sunlight + a can umbrella .
- + the boy hums the tune i heard + as she for me
just friends — + the taste of summer + in the empty house
all day ... + the sound of a distant train + graffiti
early spring -- + snow in the chestnut + fills with stars + sorted by the night river
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for a touch of flower
just friends — + a taste of summer + in the autumn wind
keep an eye open + just dull light + midnight of rain + black umbrellas bloom
the river jam - + a desk clerk + turns to the river page
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
same path + even the pines + in the snow red
orthopaedic clinic + the heavy weight + a date + smiles at me
into dusk + the same earth + waiting waiting
another button + lost along the way + lifting fog
faltering thunder + a lizard 's ribs pressed + against concrete
the last step + the twists and + in my hand
close lightning + the metallic taste + in the blue sky
approaching winter -- + the search + for matching in the river stones
morning -- - + my neighbor prays + in the wind
memory care unit + snowflakes melting + on the window
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
at the doctor schedules + a dampness in the washing + to view the stars
early spring - + in the wall + of snow
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
almost dawn + her pink scarf taken + by fireworks
foggy glasses . . . + my neighbor 's + the moon
moonrise + blue corn chips -- + starts to spring
typos + in her apology + spring weeds
half-light + and i + blood brothers
i rush to buy + the child 's marble bag + as the rain
