death watch ended + the silence + a long after the breeze + the rose
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
morning rain + the sheets where she slept + grow colder
despite the day + a bit + lost in the clouds + new of the loon
winter fog + dissolving cypress - + sfumato
morning + the witching hour + on the pond + the smell of the moon
just friends â€” + the tea leaves . + her braids
my ford explorer + the child 's marble bag + the same question twice
an old lady called + from the other end + a glimmer of youth
distant temple drums + close + near the floating + down the mountain
late winter solstice + the widow tightens + her braids
all his day + a wet maple leaf sticks + the milky way
cloud shadows + his morning mist + through the gate to the pond + the sound of crickets
the underside + of lawnmowers + a scent of rain + on the aerials
the ides + of a hot downpour + electric summer
early spring + everything + dripping
maple twig + the tea kettle + silenced
heavy rain + christmas just + the empty mind + a hole in the snow + of summer night
a dull ache + settles deep + inside the sky
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
dark days -- + seabirds string + between pier lights
dawn + the landscape + playing a youth + watched
the road + the twists and turns + in the garden + the spring in the green grass
a sudden chill + the rainbow in the + first frost
so cold + dreaming + of a dried 's earth -- - + a poster of + on my wings
the space + a child 's hand , + the cold morning air
early spring + the minty freshness + of her breastcancer + empty garden + summer 's weight
death + the fog makes the mirror + in the sky
knitting + the last whistle of a dog + burning itself
the beach- + the dog + left behind
the silence + of a damselfly + kite festival
still soup + the silence beyond + the streetlight
