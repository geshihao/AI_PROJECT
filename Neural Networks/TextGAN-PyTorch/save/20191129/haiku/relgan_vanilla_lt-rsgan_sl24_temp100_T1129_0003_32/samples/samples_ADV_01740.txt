fading + right before my eyes -- + two limes + in the rain
my father 's hammer + warm again + an old memories
weathered wall- + the smell of fish + along the highway + a of action verbs
hot chocolate + my neighbour bag + with one day
starless night -- + my favorite pub loses + above the moon
indian summer -- - + a long line of women + at the ice cream cart
far from wall street + a cormorant + dives
my father + a crows sweet traffic + to haiku
struggling from + the building site + on the sidewalk
a soda can + shot full moon + in silence
all saints morning + . . . . + autumn equinox + and a cloud
i rush + reading the last page + with school girls
up in the path + a day moon + rising moon
snuffing the branch the way + to the graveyard + old shoes
tropical storm warning + wet sand in our kisses + she of the computer
typos + in the moonlight -- + his milky
early spring + everything + dripping
honolulu airport + breathing wet i + falling rice
what thing cries + on the cold spring + a winter moon + and what i do n't
break up + the witching hour + at every old temple -- + his empty turtle ?
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
tools rusting + unused under + the spring in the stars ...
here and there + breaking through the dusk 's mist + with my computer
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
... + a few petals + sings out of his feet + in his sneakers
some ago + the sound of a horse galloping + through the pond
late winter moon + all day long + broken promises
all day + the agonized roars + as the old oak dies
an orange and pink sky + with a lie + fishing
chrysanthemum moon + the sound of my words + and many steps
those shells + the same earth + waiting waiting
between fiery clouds + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire
