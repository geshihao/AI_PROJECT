long ago -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
a furniture store + where the church used to be + vernal equinox
early spring - + yellow windows + in the light
winter evening - + a dead carved + by song alone
leap trail -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + for the parking
solo trip + in the campfire smoke + old memories
snow + mixed with snow + the asylum seeker + thoughts on the land
not one + in the empty motel + of the tiny world + of a satellite dish
emptied fountain + carried by the wind + silt scent
spring mist + my neighbour asks + to let rain
desert twilight + the warmth of his back + against mine
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
ripened tomatoes— + the long cold snap + on the gin bottles
those shells + we collected for her— + high tide
autumn evening - + after the shower of + frogs
early spring -- + yellow flower + bends the candle
rush hour + a light in the basement + in the bird 's tree
clear sky - + putting some -- - + a poster of rain
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
my tea gets colder + evening my clothes + appartment block
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
our shadows + the honks + returning cart
spring cleaning - + my breath clouds + on the car door
at the lawn concert - + he only wants to learn + her braids
the recession -- - + a harvest moon + wrapped with clouds
snow field + my cat opens one eye + halfway
mountain storm + somewhere during its echo + my husband husband , so much to pronounce + hiroshima
night shift -- + a quick break up above + christmas tea
four am ~ + the silence between tick + its silence
menopause - + she even quarrels with + in the bird 's fog
he looks at her morning -- + her husband + in the cold night
