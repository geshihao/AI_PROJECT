thunder + my mother forgets + a sun in the quarter + autumn rain
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + smell of rain
my hips + she leaves circle + on the wall empty
grey today + in the air + the last rose + still wrapped in my window
deep silence + the orphaned nestlings + this third morning
tulips + where the sheperds used + the open mouth + of a water ...
heavy rain + christmas only + from here + a new year + spill down
that spring moon -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
spring mist + the tree i take + into the scent + of rain
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on time christmas
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
autumn + finding an old flame + on facebook
dry thunder + day by the door + with the clock rain + an open book
new year + fireworks + the first cow + heads of snow
new year + looking at midnight + on the window
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
first light + the landscape + in the sky + on the last cloud
morning mist + the first drop of sweat + on a foggy
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
meditating + on the empty + tequila bottle street + autumn rain
darkening trees + the sound of hammering + on the empty + changes everything
new year + fireworks + the same song + used to our breath + july 's last night
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
night stroll + sound of + crunching snails
hospice window + she teaches her grandchild + on my daughter 's rain + so cold night in
friday the 13th -- + a bit of volcanic ash + on the asphalt
silver spring -- + the last whistle of something + as i turn on a reading + harvest moon
a pagoda + in the wood of elder + he left a new twist + in the rose
sudden rain + on the end of an + in the noon sky
her cooled + her sunday dress + with no one + morning sky
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the speaker
moonless night + the cyclist + without lights + after my comment
