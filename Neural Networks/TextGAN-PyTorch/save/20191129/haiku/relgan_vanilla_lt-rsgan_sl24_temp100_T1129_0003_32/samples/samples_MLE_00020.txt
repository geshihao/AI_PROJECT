winter rain + we half assembled shelves + the road
shades too + mum on the wood + more smile
sharp the dragon + circles dangle + abandoned mother ’ s way
some work + a scapula + to watch
under a plane - + the growth too dark + in the scent
into sunshine - + the blue day + of heavy rain
prayer lamp + the refrigerator freezes + the mother ’ s song
playing corn + long path to find the door + wrapped through an mist
no moisture to the sun + on the plate green
summer corn -- + my cemetery - + too many skin
my father walks from + trying to bronze bell + arrows much white
wildflowers + too thunder on the silence + dogs deepens
moths bush + the muzzle skyline day + break in the rain
frozen farmhouse + the apple leaves flutter + in the scent
all making today + presents . . . + winter morning mist
under the shoebox the roof + same lock
dense gazing behind + her child asks me + in my pocket—
groundhog day + my daughter drawing + in a glass
steady wind -- the + someone + cold rainy season
pigeons gun the ruins + of blue dawn ~ + old shoes
year of spring day -- the road + frozen pants
dusk + against-the-wind buttered drone of a plane + in her direction
after a quarter - + the phone goes out + at dawn
croton piercing : + scent of mimosa + autumn 's end
six , + the moon slips against cedars + to right
the numbness + a cloud buddha + your stand
trains + the shadow floating + a day long stars + lives of kona
daylight days bulb + the taste of wild stars + more to bird-song
traffic moon -- + the dog welder shelter + finally umbrellas + beside a rain
hard lasting night + silent construction cranes + rising higher
food delivery and road + the daughter red paving + a blue scent
sunset afternoon -- + every year of rooster windows + to cooking
