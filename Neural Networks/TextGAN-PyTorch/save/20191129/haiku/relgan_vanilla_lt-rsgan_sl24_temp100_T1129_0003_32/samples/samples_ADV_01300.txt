autumn chill + become last floating + down river
waning moon + the cricket behind her shadow + also deserted
crystal morning + dried puke + on the car door
evening + a few blocks closer + than yesterday + cling the sprinkler
confucius + another long path + to the old pond
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
arguing downstairs -- + she shuts + one by one
under the moon + the river 's current + dragging stars
too rush + in the tea leaves -- + her husband in the road is + she 's chair
tropical storm warning + wet sand in our + in the sky
farmwife + coloured garland + hanging on the cold rain
moonbeamsâ€” + a clump of mushrooms + where the to pluck . . . + about the tide
very dry + my darkness + through the reeds + that touch her hair
along the walls + family way the bare trees + support them down wall date
doing the dishes - + a tiny soap bubble rises + toward heaven
all saints morning + busy pink tongue + my new 's last
almost dawn + the last leaves + the streetlight
tai chi - + dogs surround him barking + ... do they smell tiger ?
all saints morning + from the corner of my eye + our silence
hillside thunder + barely a water garden + on the pine
dark days + another me + a cold slow clouds + in the sky ?
climatic change + under heavy snow + on the leave + & through grass
into dusk + the space between us + filling with a walking + of an out mosquitoes
lightning at window + another mailbox loses + to the bee floats
august wind + on the dock seagulls + stand rain
lightning at sunset -- - + the pier is littered + autumn rain
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
night shift -- + the christmas 's + at the stars ... + a break in the clouds
you have + the first glow + from the refinery night
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
chilly tea-time -- + finding new cyclamen leaves + in the road
