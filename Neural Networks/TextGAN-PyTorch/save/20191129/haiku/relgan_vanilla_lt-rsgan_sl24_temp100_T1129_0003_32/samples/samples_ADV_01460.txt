harvest moon -- + she tells the bartender + she 's left -- her eyeglasses + a flock of stars
vanishing difference . . . + gliding geese settle onto + their reflections
frozen pond— + white antlers rise + through falling leaves
to paint around + the a circles in the bare + trees shrouded
school bus + finally round the bend + lighting the warmth of the sunset + a clean slate
war vet on the corner + holding the window + on the pine
sunday morning -- + a brightness to find + what might sand in my stars
fountain pen ink spill + not contained by a blotter + mare crisium
july sunset -- - + only ones night at midnight -- - + no stock brokers
industrial decay -- + a rooster crows + for the bottle + of whipped cream truck
your reflection + floating in the wind : + my daughter 's + yellow flower
your reflection + floating in its feet + she finally it in
rearview -- - still - + homeless flag + on the christmas lights -- -
. lace and rain + fading monutains + grey over grey .
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + across the sky
full moon night -- + a smiling of the daffodils + - motionless
slice by slice + the pie disappears— + blueberry stains
drought + a dampness in the washing + left out of reach
into dusk + the same earth + waiting waiting
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
midnight + the silence beyond + the streetlight
removing her wedding + a windshield and a bug + find each other
the ocean playground + i walk the sky -- + a snow red dragonfly
prayer lamp - + a yogi pisses + in a drinking glass
leaves breeze + someone honks when + the light turns in the rain forest + hidden in the attic
half moon + halfway through the book open + stuck of the dead field
raking the leaves ~ + wind blows + on the stone buddha
all saints morning + first light - + a poster of rain + two of her breastcancer ...
left by simmer after + the witching hour + on both sides
a sudden chill -- - + my neighbor prays + on the moon
even a memory + of suburban + still the first time she notices + my silences
twilight + the silence beyond + the streetlight
