quiet dawn- + a sound of a ladder + lengthening
a sudden chill -- - + there is rice + against-the-wind mention of dirty snow
an orange and pink sky + the bright scent + of melon
emptied fountain + carried by the scent + of autumn rain
those shells + raindrops on the gate + my morning loads on stone
blood on barbed wire + in the cherry beach + on the salt 's window
a tiny ’ s clematis + my name called + from the other site
between doses + of cough medicine + silence
alone + without the dandelion + long passed + ... he hauds up her lung x-ray
scattered wind + fragments of conversation + drift from the window
dawn -- - + the black woman + in the red bird 's fog
autumn equinox -- + the last of the pollen + of a single leaf leaves + my grandmother ’ s brogue
red poppies ... + the butterfly always just + out of reach
those shells + we collected for her— + high tide
calla lily + the sound of a ladder + lengthening
loon calls + in the tea house -- - + a poster of darkness
roadside puddle + in between skyscrapers -- + a second cup of coffee + on the pond
a ladder leans + for the fire truck bubble + into twilight
early morning + ant in deep + a winter lantern too + towards the blue 's headlights
contemplating + nightfall falling in the river + a youth of the daffodils + over the bay . . .
broken cold + dreaming + of my ex-wife
again winds + each spoonful + of a hot fireworks
canyon : + at the very edge + riversound
the space + between etched names ... + war cenotaph
indian summer + turkey feather falling + to the sky
early spring + everything + dripping
late winter rain -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
customs ' declaration - + determining the value + of new haiku
shortest day -- + her countdown + quickens
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
the space + between etched names ... + war cenotaph
from under the dock + come the canada geese + summer rain
