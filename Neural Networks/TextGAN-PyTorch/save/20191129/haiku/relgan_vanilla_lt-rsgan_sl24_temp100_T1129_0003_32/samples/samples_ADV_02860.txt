easter in time + the tree i walk through + her butterfly net
olive wood + ... homeless + in the spring
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
more piercing + in the window blade + midsummer out
chilly morning -- + my light beer + suddenly darker
cloud drifts + steps after the talk of revelations + my words
blister moon + a sound of women + pounding rice
long fog -- - + a witch passes me + hat less
even and used + the calf + we failed in the marsh
blue sky -- - + the graffiti looks + dirtier of
tools rusting + unused on the leaves + cover where the house
standing stock-still : + morning glories appear + on the car 's end
just friends — + winter moon descending + beyond the trees
in the orchard + rotten apples now crunchy + winter rain
murmur of thunder- + slicing just-picked peaches + for the pie
slice by slice + to many power station + in the sky
a dull ache + settles deep -- - + a poster of mccain
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than the photograph
just friends — + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire
over monday coffee + the conversation of a + changes back
spring mist + the magpie turns over the sky + over the bay . . . . .
in the hospice + dark mirror + ...
chilled by spring winds + schoolgirls sniffing body spray + behind the gym
pouring more coffee + into empty breeze + from the latin mass
nude beach + a light in the basement + still summer
sipping more coffee slowly + my warms her hands + on the rose bush
dusk -- + a late-night + visitor
night cold date + close together + to study the menu
mosquito 's office couch + his talk about + to the deep north
poetry books + banished to over the chair + worth in dark
late winter -- - + only ones on cherry leaves drift stop + on the moon
night of stars + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire
