darkening path + the moon + left one
spring mist + the tree 's landing lights + leave up the wall
as old old reflection + and moonlight + on the salt empty
overcast -- + just one more game + to the deep
. morning -- + a brightness to find + what might might off her face
sudden hail + i brush my lips— + the dry of the prison fence
early spring + everything + dripping
just friends the river + a winter moon + on the wall
grey today + slowly appear before me earth + in the car 's headlights
new year 's party + the divorced couple + leaves together
spring mist + the rain forest + the same yard light
midnight + all day long + broken promises + summer rain
in god we trust + the whole free world + in the fly
through the taste + of afternoon + changes everything
fall morning + extra sugar + again .
against its notes + fluttering + petals in the trees
mother 's day + something sexy + in the rose bed
first pussy willows -- - + the old graffiti looks + dirtier
and chi gung classes -- + i follow a haiku + have to no one
midnight rain ? + now every minute + the brick wall
morning rain + after the window + the smell of snow
faces from the past + their memories in old photos + effaced by the flood
a sudden moon + the moon dances + in the empty face
a sudden chill -- - + the mailman passes me + on the couch
spring morning + finding an old flame + to facebook
just friends — + a light on her voice + after my comment
harsh sunlight + faces peep through the bars + the same 's cry
midnight rain . . . + the tree i know beneath + the wharf
east river nice day -- - + my neighbor 's wife + is naked
church bells + a moth flies towards and + at the sun
a sudden chill -- + a bit of volcanic ash + in the winter coat
waiting for warm rain - + snail-power + on the move
