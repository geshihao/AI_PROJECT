open window + the landscape coming + to a stop + of an autumn rain
passes by the end + of a text + april silence
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
snowflakes + on the branch + in the open doorway + my silences

the haze lifts + from the to she + childhood in dark
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
the curved woman + with its grey hair + snowy sky
after-party + we blow out candles + to hear the newborn
twilight -- + the monologue + of every night
in god we trust -- + an only + an apple lullaby + into autumn leaves
past midnight + another , in + her thin on the + of her lipstick
the new year + fireworks + a date + on wall street
spring drizzle + rounding the thorn + the smell of snow + on the gin bottles
unknotting + the fog rolling + over the border town ...
flowing estuary + native languages + in the compartment
hospice window + she teaches her grandchild + to light
a long wooden pier + on the cold spring morning -- - + my neighbor 's wife
cold snap -- + all the highlighted passages + in the wind
dentist + mist between etched + the sound of a heat + nuzzles the mountain
all saints morning + . . . . + morning what might this morning on snow
early morning + ant traffic + on the blue wave
late winter greys -- + seabirds string + between pier lights
spring mist + the tree i walk through + her butterfly net
death + in the cold spring + from the wet glossy + my cup empty
sudden - + cormorants ' flights + waves lapping
spring mist + my neighbour asks + in the pine
silent flight + from the cherry house -- + endless tv ads + for a haiku
you have - + the bridge with darkness + on an morning rain
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
rush hour - + through an old barn + end of the rainbow
humid morning + ant traffic we + on the garden path
