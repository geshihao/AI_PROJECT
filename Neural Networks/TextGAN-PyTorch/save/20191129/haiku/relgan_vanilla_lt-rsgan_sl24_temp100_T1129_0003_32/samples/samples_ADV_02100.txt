looking for something + my is full moon + among the mature corn
old woman , + a rainbow warms + large in the morning
autumn equinox -- + two limes + in the wind
easter -- + all the shadows of the sun + under a black + autumn evening
between the drone + of lawnmowers + a new moon
gare du nord + in the buttercups + again . . . + a scent of rain
the page-finders + of my father ’ s daily missal + losing their colors
seed catalog + same flickering + at the sky
without miles per gallon + bush thanks you for the + first smile
empty lot . . . + young girls harvest + rice from no mountain
my daughter starts college -- - + another star + to strike a deal for iphones
hillside thunder + barely a water + in the cookie box
late winter walk- + soft rain on bare cherry trees + harder on my wings
starless night -- + one a dog + on the hot wind
to paint around + a reek of cheap fat + lingers in the hall
from under the dock + come the canada geese + summer rain
three men and three birds + stand storm + a new spider 's hand + new year
trial separation + another inch of snow + on the gin bottles
desert mountains + but the walls traces + but not the ring of the home + i order the day
at dusk + a seagull 's flight + furrowing the silence
soft rain + fishing in the wind + the fingers of a buzzard
cold + a few blocks closer + than yesterday
exposed roots again . . . + autumn the still pond + is that conversation of birds
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + at coal cars
gazing at + a stone into the pond + sprinklings of moon
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
a ladder leans + for the fire + and my hand
arizona + road stop rest , + in dangerous
cold snap -- + a birthday reminder + i do n't know
night shift -- + the christmas + christmas rain
a pagoda + in the wood of elder trees + blow of snow
we sip sweet tea + in the distance ... + ice moon
