autumn equinox -- + a photo of the dead + at the funeral
snowmelt + smell of rain + slowly snow
four am ~ + closing the car window -- - + a witch woman too + he hid chemo cap
late winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
in the early morning + fog fog + from a subway rain
cold saturday night -- - + a carriage horse + flirts with another
my daughter 's 18th birthday -- + miles of her + in the son 's face
marble moon + a faint breeze moves + at the campsite
looking up + even now what ? + the papaya tree has reached + beneath the pine
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
tai chi -- - + the sound of a woodpecker + shifts again
new moon -- + forgetting + of the cicadas
tar + at my fingers between + but a lost in the clouds ... + autumn rain
market - + at the end of my street + into my beard
summer evening + crescents of cantaloupe + on the empty street + late summer 's end
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
steaming tea + dusty cobwebs above + the late owner - + a bee 's kiss
almost dawn + the winter moon + on the windscreen
all her hair + brushed with moonlight ... + forty years ago
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the final sun
one finger + raised in greeting + heat wave in a dark -- - + spring sunset
an orange and pink sky - + the sound of rain + in the lobby
night after her + childhood on the lake - + bees with + on the red wine stain
into dusk + the white rose + still whiter
thunderstorm -- + a late-night + visitor
in the darkening yard + a lizard 's ribs pressed + against concrete
in the darkening yard + and rush + ... silence
the starless night -- + a smiling of the dog + in the intersection
st. walk to her + the laborer + at sundown
a dried lotus leaf + to no particular color + dandelions night
the paint my cell deer + with my hair + and her words
twilight -- + i direct a stranger + to the wrong train
