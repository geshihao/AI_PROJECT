easter in time -- - + my neighbor prays + in the wind
early spring + everything + dripping
new year + fireworks + a long of the weight + of my comment
to the dead + dragonflies escape from + the morning + sunshine the night
winter solstice + candle too much + for the sea
rivulets + a breeze stirs the spent petals + on the blue 's end
one by one + fireflies escape from + my name
mackerel sky -- - + no line of women + in the fog
a sudden chill -- + a bit of volcanic ash + in the winter fog
bones buried in the yard + rows of tidy daffodils + oh so very yellow line
he looks perplexed + another star appears + in the sky
sunny storm + the winter moon + on the sidewalk
against - + the girl brushing her hair + smiles from the sunset
almost dawn -- - + a dead leaf + to the ground
indian summer -- + a few tentative steps + on the river ice
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the aerials
despite + the foreclosure sign + daffodills
steady rain + my mother forgets + who i am light
early spring + everything + dripping
standing stock-still : + she deer + old husband 's fresh -- - + autumn rain
half moon -- - + umbrellas + go in the wind -- + a turtle in dark
out + of the first leaf + on the wall + degas ' ballerinas
grows fountain + carried by the scent + of rain
a candle + left burning cranes away still + his wish
evening fog -- - + nothing but ears + above the first frost
the stars . . . . + my new bed + a owl flies home
starless night -- + she playing + on the same
tall grass + an empty laundromat + its mother 's tree + tighter and tighter
distant temple drums + close slowly + into the text + april breath
into dusk + a few petals fall + from the tree
day long clouds -- + there is rice + in the sky
snuffing the flame + on the quiet morning + still the mountain
