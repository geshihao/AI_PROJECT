autumn cleaning + a cobra escapes from + the bronx zoo
late winter snow + the silence + a bee + in the autumn day
dew + lifting + into the scent + of asphalt
autumn seabreeze + a light in the basement + in the rose bed
a bee chose + the child 's ribs pressed + in the garden buddha
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
new year + the calicantus morning + at the park + and i
subway transfer + the homeless lady + sells mirrors
the recession -- + the stars are + sunshine the stars ...
the underside + of lawnmowers + the last 's day + the smell of rain
the day hides + the rain + at the end + a thin lullaby + of smoke
coming up through + the tree i be + out of the lot
spring the roofs -- + a faint essence + of mothballs
long lasting rain - + my breath + fogs the window
open window + the for sale , + a winter moon + the harvest moon
garden + on the branch + the sun in her voice + after the shower
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
seed catalog + the colours + of a incense + changes everything
summer in the fog + a few spots of red + first robins war
almost dawn + the tea leaves + rainy night + the silver the clouds
spring + the silence + the child 's marble bag + in the sky ?
the silence + the child 's marble bag + from the other site
morning + in the tea house + the smell + of the lupine leaves
late spring + a few petals + the morning + rain begins
pines + the first + at the sidewalk + with the sky + at the sky
along the pavement + the asphalt + in the blue sky + the morning
overcast night + maybe the + forest of a crypt . .
autumn mist + the silence + our breaths out + in the white toilet
from the suite dusk + the warmth of his back + of the sea
as the train passes + the same old games - + the sound of a heat + still wrapped
the cat shifts + from sunspot to sunspot + sunday morning + morning morning
autumn chill + the silence + our breaths through + the night garden
