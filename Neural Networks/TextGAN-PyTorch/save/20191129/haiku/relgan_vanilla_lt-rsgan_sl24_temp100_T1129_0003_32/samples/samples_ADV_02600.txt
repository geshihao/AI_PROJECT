september sunset -- - + a pigeon retracts + its neck
the darkness + onion bulbs sprouting + into the night 's over
one by one + fireflies escape from + a crocus
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
huddled smokers -- + another night + without strike a deal for iphones
autumn equinox -- + a second cup + of bad coffee
fresh peaches -- + my mother storm + pierces the river
petals + an landscape coming + to i wish i could give you + about the same bedtime
your reflection + floating in the tea cup + he tells me she + at the red wine
master wind + sweeping the temple + zealously
leaves potato chips + nobody can write + just one
just friends â€” + the child fills in her eyes -- + chilled wind
locked and and go + but the dry + new address
late winter rain + my socks + on the subway
the brush + is dipped deeper + in chinese ink
labor day -- + another company cuts + health benefits
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
old pond -- + koi swim + slightly off center
spring evening - + my best haiku ever + ... ... digested
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
sunday morning -- - + the stars shine + in the storm
endless rain + after the eclipse + the scent of burning leaves
a moon searches + the dry grass + sundogs
finally the way to work + the fog rolling + of her butterfly
solo trip + in the campfire smoke + old memories
molten by one + day by day + the moonlit night + coming in its own shoes
among the carpet + is wearing thin + silence
dry thunder + my air conditioner + smell of rain
morning mist + the patter of raindrops + on my rooftiles
crowded championship + to the lawn ornaments + lighting with the new year + a glimmer roses
despite my assurances + my wife 's makeup + thicker
sleeping late at night - + the horn + of a water
