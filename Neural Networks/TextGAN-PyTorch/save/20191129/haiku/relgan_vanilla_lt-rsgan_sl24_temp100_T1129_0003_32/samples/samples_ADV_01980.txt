arguing downstairs -- + all my clothes + her braids
midnight + all day long + broken promises + summer rain
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red garbage bag
first light + an unknown bird + sings me -- - + the cicadas of willows + sunlight eleven
a sudden chill -- + a late-night + visitor
poetry books + banished to over the rain + brightly lit
almost dawn + a small crack in the thick + left of the mountain
open window + the silence beyond + the streetlight
despite my assurances + my wife 's makeup + thicker
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
how some things end— + onion flakes + on the market sack
dentist 's office -- + a wave of cirrus breaks + summer rain
day long faded + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire
bight of rain + fading monutains + grey over grey sea
autumn rose— + even as i sketch the wind + more petals fall
drinking mulled wine + on the square -- + white breaths -- - + a half moon
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
after the bombing + i open the lights without glass + has a tussock
a dull ache + settles deep + inside my breasts + in the valley
drunk on the beach- + the my ear + on my voice
starless night -- + my favorite pub loses + above the water
lulled to sleep + by gutter sounds + spring dreaming
mixed precipitation -- - + a flat finish + on fire
tired new mom - + brown the carousel music + for the pie
a dull ache + settles deep + inside the stars ...
chrysanthemum moon + the sound of my words + and many steps
hearing the call for prayer + as i pass the + cemetery ground
from under the dock + the fog makes the sky - + a red dragonfly
fading light + an old desoto + into the lawn light
strategic plan - + the sound of a horse galloping + through leaves
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the parking sky
winter evening - + the grey morning glories + from the tallest tree
