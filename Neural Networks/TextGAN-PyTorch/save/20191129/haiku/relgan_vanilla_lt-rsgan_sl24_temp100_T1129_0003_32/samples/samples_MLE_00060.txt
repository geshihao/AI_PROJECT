3:00 a.m. -- + the monologue + i watch the moon
almost summer sunset -- - + new graffiti looks + to the bee plans
summer night love + whatever in half the road off + for the mountain sky
crescent moon -- + a flock to sandpiper splits + passing back on again
spring showers -- + my walking stick pierces + crusted 's end
death watch + drowned by the dead leaf + of the ceremony
morning fog -- - + the mailman passes stick pierces + crusted snow
my tea gets colder + she left the plastic bags + the dark road
house and the moon , , + planted blossom
domestic terrorism + a bug + find each other + myself
spicy chicken + onions + sprouting
ripened tomatoes— + a busy gray + silently
east river -- - + the sun turns the same clouds + harder on the blue dawn
homesick— + sundown just behind + local traffic only
drifting + ants inside through the broken window + from the goldenrod
drifting noise - + yellow leaves among the axe blade + is smile disappeared
distant voices + a thin crust of ice + stifling dusk
traffic jam + three saffron-robed men munch nuts + to the old eyes
veteran 's day -- + the heart-shaped tracks to birds + white butterfly
news to call + the dinner takes + the morning
moonless night -- + pulling sound + a jumping fish
new moon + the cricket behind her voice cracks + next to lilacs
fish bone + a golden star beneath + the wharf
the child of . . . + the way the bare trees + support them
two minutes tea + a map with distant life + long rainy night
slice rising + from weeds + the blue flashing
ancient warmth + of the laundry lights + watching a fishing in running ? + the sound of crickets
heavy rain -- + the faint scent + of mother ’ s shadow
yesterday dusk - + every mile or + from a train cloud
first crowing + breaks the corn fields + bisected infinity
summer 's end + a bowl of brown rice miso + to haiku
longest night— + my daughter 's + childhood home
