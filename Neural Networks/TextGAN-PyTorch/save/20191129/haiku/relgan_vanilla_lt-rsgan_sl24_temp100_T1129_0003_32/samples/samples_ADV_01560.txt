from under the dock + come the canada geese + a white butterfly
contemplating + nightfall falling + in the old temple + you with the moon + instead
drought + a dampness in the washing + left out of reach
blackbird night date + sand in her bra + on the snow red
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
an orange and pink sky + with the campfire smoke + old memories
my father + a her twins + a pregnant woman + and his death ticking
troubled sleep -- + an old stories get a + wears a new of autumn ?
each sip sweet tea + a white moth makes noise up + through the north window
stone she 'll + my daughter drawing circles + on the rose bush
year end + a convict 's calendar + in the road
midday lilies + my hands recalling + this moonlight—
coffee rings + the tree i have n't take + into the box
he looks at + after the empty + broken too light penetrates + the bamboo grove
as i pass a + the autumn wind + on the pine
an orange and pink sky + the last i wake + looks far away
morning in french + the child drowned + papyri in the fog
pan-fried trout + in the autumn mist + an old temple in her eyes -- + chilled wind
superbowl sunday -- - + clouds between ports + a moon - from a + up home
summit cairn + the damp scent of approaching + eucalyptus
prayer lamp - + something of me + on the moth 's end
rain-laden cedars + the murmur of waves + slowly changes a garden + aimlessly
retirement home — + her back + without more birds + morning skies -- -
as the sound + of afternoon heat + with one who i remember + phone number and key
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stars ...
is it + on the epitaph- + a reek of cheap fat + lingers
calling to work + some passengers + speak ... + autumn 's end
on the hill + flock of scattered houses + without shepherd
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly falls
harsh by snow + flying again + morning in snow
