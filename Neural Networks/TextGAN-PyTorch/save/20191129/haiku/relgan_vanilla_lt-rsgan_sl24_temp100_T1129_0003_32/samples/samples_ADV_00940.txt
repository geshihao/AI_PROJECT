sun rising + suddenly the sumac + with a passing -- - + autumn rain
february first + room by room + the sound of hammering + from haiku
quiet lake -- + with the first cow + heads to autumn + her breasts in the cat 's + new year 's eve
naked + finally he comes out + as the news to my thoughts + of the night sky
erosion ~ + the lingering + still the way he says + `` whatever ''
winter + at the end + of a long learning curve + a helmut of white hair
a lake + brimming with mountainsâ€” + trout ripple the last + changes lit
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
spring mist + the tree i + attention span
sunset -- - + she ties her bikini top + to strike a deal for iphones
all saints morning + clouds appear + on the blue wave
half the village burning + while the same + a winter moon descending + across the sky
a sudden chill -- + a beach from + her braids
at the moon -- + the mouse trap + snaps
tulips buried + an old desoto + into the window
blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
long lasting + in the cold spring + a light in her eyes + to cold night
almost dawn + the last leaves + on the red traffic light
close lightning + the metallic taste + in the old cat 's wall + empty morning empty
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky + the long curve of the horn + a winter rain
unknotting + the hammock ropes + her braids
wakes the silence + of the april gate + the phone 's song + and morning snow
troubled sleep -- + the sound of a heat + with a crosses + the sky
weathered wall- + the window 's light + in the storm
coffee rings + a breeze moves + along the way + summer rain
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
sunrise -- + new graffiti + in the car 's evening + new year 's window
from under the dock + the child drowned + papyri in a child 's ? + a fish i rhyme
between doses + where the mirror + with a spider 's call + much much louder
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
