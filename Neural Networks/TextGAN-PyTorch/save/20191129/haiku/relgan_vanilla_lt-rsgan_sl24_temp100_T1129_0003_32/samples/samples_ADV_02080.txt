happy hour -- + i open my clothes + to right seeds
almost christmas ~ + thinking how best how + to the rain geese
raking the leaves ~ + wind blows + on the moon
just friends — + a taste of summer + in her kiss
twelve years + presents + from the moth road 's swale meets nature + memento mori
a sudden chill -- - + dew drops on the cover + on his glasses
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly falls
reflecting rain + a few spots of red + first robins
madison square park -- - + the sound of a woodpecker + shifts again
early spring + everything + dripping
indian summer - + bees ' + this shadows in frost
monday dawn + the fog thick + at every window
morning fog -- - + nothing but ears + above the water run
late winter rain - + copper wishes collect + in the bottom of the well
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter
a spider pierces -- + opening sunset + in the cake seeds
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
into dusk + the fog makes the sky + a winter sun
autumn equinox -- + a photo of the dead + new address
to paint around + a reek of cheap fat + lingers
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
under the chimneys + moon rises wearily + ... another night-shift
what thing cries + on the way to autumn + to the old house
october embrace + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire
anniversary— + a few weeds + in the wind
ebb tide + on wet autumn leaves + on my reflection
questions + purl like schools of fish + from dangerous waters
5am -- + bird songs + in air conditioner conditioner + a homeless
first pussy willows -- - + i watch + on the end of reach
news + my buys new + colour contacts + in the sky
calling to the sun + we what have a tractor -- - + summer full moon
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
