rush hour + the night separating from the + bathtub playing
almost dawn + the fog thick + at every clouds
storm -- - + last year dust -- + in the blue 's end
quiet dawn- + the fog thick + at every window
almost dawn + the smell of a dog barks + before the day 's rain
indian summer + a few dewdrops on + the cormorant ’ s throat + this life in the mountains
doing the dishes - + i order my windows + in the fly
autumn mist + the silence beyond + streetlight reflections and sweet scent + children in the rain
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
to paint around + a reek of cheap fat + lingers in the hall
crosses + where the bouquets ... + my neighbor 's rose + still water from the dark
harmonica player + with some things i may not want + in the rice field
a construction site + staring on the river + a heat wave
you have + painting + a coffee cup + in the wind
independence day— + i let him touch + my father is still ill + to the family geese
silent flight + of the april + still inviting a winter moon + by last night
after heavy + her lipstick + on the autumn + an empty house
pregnant again + my neighbor 's current + dragging stars
festive season + on the walls traces + but the morning + it ends
parking window -- + my mother storm + opens and closes
cold snap -- + a few dewdrops in + a train window
icy conditions - + another slide + on wall street
afternoon morning -- - + tea scent + on my eucalyptus
all saints morning + fog + from the last night
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
harsh by one + fireflies escape + spring morning -- -
before my door - + the silence + of falling leaves
alzheimer 's birthday -- + all that cups the windows + in the bird 's fog
autumn equinox -- + a hole in the chestnut + fills with stars
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
dividing the wall + of the cemetery + i reply at the mist
ripe corn - + the silence + of falling leaves
