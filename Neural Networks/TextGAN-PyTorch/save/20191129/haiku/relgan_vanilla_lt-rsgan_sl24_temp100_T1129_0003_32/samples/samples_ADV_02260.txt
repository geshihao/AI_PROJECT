desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
gone from + the same haiku + when me it 's over + a winter day
half moon + halfway through + this winter winter moon -- + july rain
snow field + the cat opens one eye + halfway
hill + the ruins of my voice + carrying eggs + across the ice .
the brush + is dipped deeper + than the rain come and me + in the dark
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + and then
summer fog -- + layers of color + in the sand
hiroshima day + only the wildest flowers + go in the moon
after harsh words + an just one more + into autumn
troubled sleep -- + somewhere + a candle + a new fence + her breasts
husband at work ? + the mailman knocks + her husband complains again
an orange and pink sky . . . + my hand - + autumn deepens
alongside the train tracks -- + secrets of orchids + under moonlight
puddle + my heartbeat quickens + through the avalanche zone + see the last of light
sculpting + clay , in the , + room by room
between the yoga + and chi gung classes -- + scent of burning sage
i arrange my tie + warm my window + from my shells
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
autumn equinox -- + a patch of blue + of home
he looks at her morning -- - + her gray sweater lifts + between watch the stars
indian summer -- + my aunt corrects + the shape of his line + summer haze
molten by slice + in the old temple + zealously
january -- + a bead of sweat + on my wings
a dried lotus leaf + after many of rain + etched the summer
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
hot chocolate + the sound of a horse galloping + at the pond
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
on her nape + beads of rain + on the seats
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
asylum + on the walls traces + but not the ring of his love + cold autumn day
early spring + everything + dripping
