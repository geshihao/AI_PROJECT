early spring + everything + dripping
just friends — + a taste of summer + ice rain
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly
armistice day - + the fog rolling + of the smoke wisp
emptied fountain + carried by the wind + to right itself
snowstorm— + another poem + too wordy
autumn equinox -- + my baseball glove + right where bloom
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
sunday morning -- + counting the stars + to enter the tunnel
its wine ? + within the prison walls + shadows of snow
first pussy willows -- - + an elixir of the roses + a baby 's cry
a pagoda + in the wood of elder + he left behind + her shadow
an orange and pink sky + with the phone + of tree
in god we trust -- + the small bowl + of imported ale
removing her wedding + she teaches her grandchild + on my phone screen
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
garden work— + talking to each other + back to back
chilly morning -- + mountains topped with first -- - + a friend salutes + by raising its leg
summer solstice + candle too much + in the rain out
summer solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
retirement home — + a winter fly + too slow to kill
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
almost dawn + the night separating from the + blue lights in the mountain
evening stroll + dipping our feet + in the bird 's cry
death of a dictator -- + the ebb and flow + of sea
from under the dock + come the canada geese + summer rain
early spring + everything + dripping
to paint the graveyard + grey again + autumn is here and + over the autumn rain
in the treetops + lingering , + remains of the day day
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
half-light + the cat turns and washes + in the air
dentist + mist between etched + morning glories appear + in the car 's headlights
