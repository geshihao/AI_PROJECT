the slow + and chi gung classes -- + the baby stirs + to the seeds
a dull ache + settles deep + inside the sky
one by a -- + endless stars + the river day
spring rain + the scent + of unknown flowers + the ocean flight
snowstorm— + another poem + too wordy
meditating + on the walls traces + but the dandelion + darkness
september sunset -- + the monologue + of every tree
valentine 's day + a patch + of snow
forest + the tea leaves + with the sunrise - + appartment block
autumn equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold
the cold snap + not sharing + the sky without a + field of snow
an orange and pink sky + her silence + in the tree 's dream
i rush + the same + at the edge of the moon + a white butterfly
the glare off snow + the is we women + we planted
a hawk searches + the dry grass + the rose
spring mist + the tree i take shelter under + planted in remembrance
new year + fireworks + the dog 's writhings + of a bee
smell of summer + a snail crawls up the front wheel + on the express iris
moon gazing + fogging up the sky + a winter moon + and the mountain man
apple slices- + the first leaf + the autumn wind + the rain
fallen + mist trailing + over the son + the free ’ s
sunday morning + smells of french toast + empty garden + summer 's weight
a block breeze -- + a bit + lost in the cold spring + a spring room
autumn equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold
street + half a mirror showing + a quarter in a field + a clouds
rivulets + the white cat + on wall street
new year + fireworks + the first rays + stage the broken + the winter sun
cold snap + a faint breeze moves + the morning in the light
heavy rain + a few petals + on wall street
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
death of the lawn + down . . the knees + how very still it + autumn leaves
spring cleaning + suddenly a whiff + of perfume
