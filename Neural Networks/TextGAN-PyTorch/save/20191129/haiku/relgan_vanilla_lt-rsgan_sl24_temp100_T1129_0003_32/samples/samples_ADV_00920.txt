all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in the houses
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a in law
first morning + firecracker papers + wander the streets
veteran 's day + photo of a mirror + in the blue flashing
after winter sesshin + sharing tea leaves + against the wall
a black woman + breastfeeding + her butterfly net + winter dusk . . . + a winter moon + mother 's day
along the pavement + his white breath dissolves + in the mist
high winds + the tea leaves + rainy night
train window + a faint essence + of mothballs
almost dawn + the night separating from the + blue fingers of the bar -- - + a crescent moon
slice by slice + in the beach house + wild orchids bloom + spring is here
half the village burning - + the sound of a ladder + lengthening
autumn mist + the soft silence + in the street light on the street + a single bud seconds
between the drone + of lawnmowers + a white branch the river + a winter rain
spring mist + the scent + of unknown flowers + a baby studies + her braids
summer sunset -- + a smiling of the pillow + at snowflakes
open window + silent construction + rainbow . . . + just dull light + midnight
friday afternoon -- + a brightness to find + what might have been lost
first spring - + a boy hums the tune i heard + half a mile ago
from under the dock + the child 's + still the sun
autumn rain + puddles drops from the + first time
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the loon 's beach + wild tune
nude beach + about size + on the fallen pears
beyond darkened fields , + growing with bird-song + - this tide-line of dawn
morning rain + the muscles in - + the heavy weight + a date in my purse
your reflection + floating in its : + wind-puffed primroses
the bullock cart + loaded high with shoe boxes + the driver â€™ s cracked feet
into dusk + the just one more + into the trail + a cigarette butt ?
almost dawn + her thoughts + from the pulpmill a cloud + of sunset
sunday morning -- + the cloud of the fence + a love man
away from eyes + the stairwell holds + us in its arms + the late summer
from under the dock + come the old barn -- + wind through the pines + an empty sky
