filtering in + i slow down our absence + at the campsite
seeds catalogue + the therapist + traffic garden
a curve in + the migrant speaks of a missing + winter afternoon
onion skin + through the mist + more brightly
haiku potato chips + she looks into the mirror + double shift
breaking the silence + the moon â€™ s call + in the cold winter
far from wall street + the cormorant + dives
summer - + cormorants ' flights + waves lapping
spring mist + the magpie + monochrome
sunny spring day -- - + waiting for george bush + for a haiku
new the road + of wearing camouflage + by an holes
buckets set up + beside the bed + the roof leaks
train window -- + i still to the first stars are + argument
wearing out she hides + the same page
morning tai chi ~ + the moon also shows + of my gray
winter wheat + crows answering crows + through the fog
left + the slow change of snow ' + first cup of moon
even the window - + accumulated leaves + and says it 's hungry
cajun cabin + and then i remember + the station cup
sunshine + the moon also shows + his face
snow field + of the cemetery + this autumn day
waves + slowly cresting towards shore and the moon
this road + the asylum seeker + thoughts and the sky
white meeting + i try to read my haiku ... + autumn
summer -- + another company cuts + health benefits
first day of school + the windscreen wipers + slice our bloom
indian summer- + rouging her cheeks + as she waits for the cake
marble moon + the staccato shifts + a sun
deux cygnes + remembering you + cold and warm rain
onion skin + from the tree + rain begins
superbowl sunday -- - + no line to look at + a dollar bill first time
winter + the silence beyond + the streetlight
