almost dawn + the silence beyond + the streetlight
a sudden chill -- + my credit card + declined
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
december warm spell + just before my child ’ s grip : + wind-puffed primroses
starry fireworks + the with the first scent + of fox lit
paddling slowly + ruins of my clothes + somebody looks + summer 's morning light
between doses + of cough medicine + silence
hazy skies + drifts of dead fir needles + on the road
blind date + her face half revealed + in moonlight
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in the houses

reaching up + in the sky - + a red dragonfly + of a bird 's cry
its four waitress departs + the china teapot + shakes
nothing + the little speaks + i think + lilacs my silence
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + across the sky
snow crocus + i almost forget + our quarrel
cold snap -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
