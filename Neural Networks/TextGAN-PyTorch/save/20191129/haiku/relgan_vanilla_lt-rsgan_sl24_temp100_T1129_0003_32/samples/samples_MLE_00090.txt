decorating the cell again + the candle 's mouth
valentines + freshly fried chips + on her grave
month-old obit + of the old pond + she 's late feet

early spring + the blooming crossing + the double yellow temple with snow
early march + snow shovels one away the + heavy rain
flashing against + the full moon + wrapped to snow
pinned winter -- + pulling the dog + in the wind
crystal night + snow shovels become the other 's howl + do n't enters the taxi
walking to work + pages lap at your feet + a red winter light

fighting + the summer + her butterfly this butterfly
autumn tea— + the bird on her nose + a star rises
valentine 's cry + sudden leaves together + ... '
memories of autumn + a new crop of salt + falling field
waning yellow leaves + just in the wood stork + rising higher
how washing spinach + the kitchen + has the weight
late butterfly . . . + folded wings + lean into the pond
gare du nord the moon - + fresh mango + a phone rings
— taste + in the crow 's beak ... + sultry day
loneliness ; + the same haiku + them moon
snowflakes clinic + . the graffiti looks as + dirtier 's been sober
three men and three birds + stand on the day red
evening storm + the windscreen tender ran out + of a dove
baby rabbit -- - + she is cutting + a sun tan
quitting out + under a cow ’ s chin + spring shower
in the darkening yard + bay and moon + the scent of rain
maws fecht ower the bucket -- + opening smoke in the sunset + the scent of coffee
workers on scaffolds + paint a building -- . + winter solstice
