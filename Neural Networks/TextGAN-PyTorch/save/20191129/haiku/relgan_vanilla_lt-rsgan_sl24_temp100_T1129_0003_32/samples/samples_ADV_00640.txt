as my clothes + somebody + at old girl + a white rose + still whiter
freeze warning + the wildflowers + in the storm -- - + a crescent moon + thoughts on the garden
missing child + the distinctive + and i warm rain + an old man
more piercing + in the empty + changes tiles + in the autumn wind
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
night shift - still + the christmas + christmas lights -- - + the wind
deep fog + a few spots + over the trees + on the snow
blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
spring mist + the tree i take + into the sky + over the trees
the sun rising + suddenly the silence + bigbangs into lost in
harsh sunlight + faces peep the bars + of the police van
the rail tracks + toward a harvest moon + thoughts and a water ... + smell of rain
dinner + biting into a photo + in the sky
an orange and pink sky + the silence + our silence + and no in the mountain
subway transfer + the homeless lady + sells mirrors
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
spring mist + the rain + from the tarmac
january walk his watch + on the heat + at the mist -- + the milky way
pan-fried trout + smell of rain + and a rain storm + in the sky
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
heat wave + the cat opens + on a rainy spring day
june -- + the monologue + of so many blue + on the porch lights on
the courtship -- + her husband + still the snow -- + my coffee empty
. your reflection + another , night + in my alley
wakes the silence + the night stone + into the silence + in the wind
spring morning + the is we planted + at the end + of a cow tree + in the wind
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + with a mother â€™ s + warm his cactus
spring mist + the tree i walk through + the firework smoke + summer rain
autumn rain + puddles fill falling + with rainbows + in spring snow
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + her shoes
thunder clouds + on the branch the sparrows + tighter on the glove + on my ear
. + i trace the roof + tiles + on the spring
