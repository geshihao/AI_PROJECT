the glare off + of my breath + brightly lit
dew + on the victims -- + my husband in her hair + to a lost in its
early spring + everything + dripping
starless night -- + a smiling of a dog + manhole
change in pitch + as the sound of a + pounding on the pond
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the parking cup
dance of autumn + a light in the chestnut + fills with stars
at the lawn concert + lighting the put out + a tanning salon
struggling from + the building site + in circles in the darkness
almost dawn -- + all that 's + sunshine or
men picketing + a chevy agency + a cold moon
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than the photograph
the empty nest + of the lemonade stand + for the hospice window
steam billows + on the answering + a shooting rose + still whiter
open window -- - + another beach boys tune + from the blue sky
pale moon + an empty garden + to the station wall
mosquito in + line + another street + over the clouds
lightning at window - + my breath clouds + on spring rain
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stars ...
a few petals + on the branch + summer 's end
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a red dragonfly falls
rearview mirror -- + pelicans with sunrise + on their wings
late winter rain + fading melting + on the pond
a dried lotus leaf + on the lemonade stand + evening cool
the curve in the road + looking for lilacs + to the night sky
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat
a candle + runs appear on the path + of trodden leaves
rivulets + a breeze stirs the spent petals + the morning light
february first + room by rain + indian summer
my tea gets colder + evening my notebook - + her braids
rainy night -- + a smiling of + a sun in the wind
open window + the moon - + snail in its back + ... another night-shift
