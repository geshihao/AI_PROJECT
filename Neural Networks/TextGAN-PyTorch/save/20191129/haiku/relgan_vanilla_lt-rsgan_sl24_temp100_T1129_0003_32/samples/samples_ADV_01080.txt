cold snap + all the quilts + still inviting bees
half moon + the last morning + with no particular a rain + on the day
flu season -- + under a falling + at the blue moon + and what i do n't
the path shorter + a magpie turns + out of the wood more + with mist
night watch + the oil bright + into shadows
more piercing + in a far-away land + in the wind
at the window + half a mirror showing + a quarter room
after a cold + a winter moon + on the river streetlight
dawn -- + the monologue + of every in snow
unknotting + that the fog makes the loon + to the blue tonight
machine gun fire + after the frog + on the blue wind
old woman + with its heart + the morning sun + one after roses
summer evening + crescents of cantaloupe + on the cold morning + colder still
june tea -- - + her gray sweater lifts + to show her navel
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the cold rain
paddling - + the sound of a long sun + on the peaches
day + the climbing ivy + filled with sparrows + by the night river
almost grass + the doctor touches her + uncombed tea from a + mirror
early spring - + snow in the girl + & rain
we sip sweet tea + a a her twins + a pregnant woman
emptied fountain + carried by the autumn wind + silt -- on day
silver after the air + the last ball of cheese + in his fridge
first day + first guards + locked and loaded + without shepherd
indian summer + in the aroma + spring snow + black umbrellas
facing a stiff breeze + summer shadows + of the hot tin roof
fireworks show + a faint essence + of mothballs
all sunlight + mist trailing + over the stairwell + autumn leaves
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the spider web
breakfast light + she tells the friend + returns to earth
the curved woman + a stone into the pond + sprinklings of moon
almost dawn + the night separating from the + somewhere still on the ground + spring .
cold night + my heartbeat quickens + through the avalanche zone + see this path
