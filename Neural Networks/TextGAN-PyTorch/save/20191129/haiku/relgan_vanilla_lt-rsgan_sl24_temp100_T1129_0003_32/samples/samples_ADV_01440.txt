sunny winter -- + a brightness to find + what might have been lost
buckets set up + beside the bed + a winter moon
first date + close together + to study the menu
sudden fog -- - + snowflakes settle + on the sidewalk
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
lulled + holding the cabin + changes au lait + perfect bloom
auction : + after heavy rain + on the last leaves snow
. lace + and rumors of war - + three grey lines + of melon
starts music ? + the mailman knocks + also left for me + moves in the fly
half moon + halfway through the book open + a in concrete
slow day ... + i trace my toe 's trees + on the christmas ornaments
at the lawn concert + lighting the spent + of the end of the world
autumn equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold + under my hair
simmer lift + the fallen branch carved + by the rose
darkening trees + few fire-flies + a taste of summer + empty vase
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for my teacup
rain settles + some things i may + into the night
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
midnight + all day long + broken promises + summer rain
deep fog + someone playing scales + on both sides
trains approaching + a forgotten bale of hay + slowly slowly the fading + roadkill
cool breeze + someone honks when + a winter moon
emptied fountain + carried by the wind + one after the blue sky + the scent of rain
crowded subway -- + her perfect lips + pierced the newborn
empty room ... + a asks + in the spider 's web
you have + he shadow + long after many rain + and the cat ’ s eye
almost spring + a few petals + of a winter moon -- -- + butterfly on moss + pray my sip the moon
all day + moon rises + a hot morning -
away from eyes + she i birds + on the garden
sunday morning + smells of french toast + and cinnamon ... + summer rain
harvest moon + the sound of a woodpecker + its bright line
logging road— + my heartbeat quickens + through the avalanche zone
