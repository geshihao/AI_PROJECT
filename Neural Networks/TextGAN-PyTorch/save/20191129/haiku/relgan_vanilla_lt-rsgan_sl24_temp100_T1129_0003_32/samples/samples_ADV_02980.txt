desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
sunrise -- - + a yogi does out + she 's name
filtering in the night + morning in the window + a winter moon
almost dawn + and rush + this sunday morning . .
raking the leaves ~ + wind blows + on the stone buddha
read the dishes - + a tiny soap bubble rises + toward heaven
dead leaves -- - + a witch woman up + at the end of the day
abandoned farmhouse + a yellowed grocery list taped + to the counter top + starts singing
my old life + lingering warmth + of her kiss
wood + the sound of women + pounding rice
a dried lotus leaf + in tibetan book of rain + on the rose bush
dry at sunset -- - + a dead leaf + on the pool deck
harsh by one + fireflies escape from + the convict 's pencil
rabbit morning -- - + another star appears + in his ironed
reading summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the tree
early morning + fog resting on cedars + cup of kona
fallen + the fog makes the lights without + with one
dusty knickknacks + i try to recall + a scent of burning
spring breeze -- - + she travels with + in the coffee wall
long ago + in the forgotten village + smell of her rain
crescent moon -- + a hole in the chestnut + fills with stars
silver after the air -- - + i tell my barber do something + about my gray hairs
filtering in + i peel a red onion + in running water
more piercing + in the empty + of her lipstick + on the wind
questions + purl like schools of fish + ancient to house
all i need are mountains + and morning + morning snow
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat
exposed roots . . + i squeeze the tree + to silence
to my smartphone + mount fuji in the sunset -- - + a day moon
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
a pagoda + in the wood of elder trees + blow of geese
neighbor â€™ s clematis + the lingering window + still wrapped
