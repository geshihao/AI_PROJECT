rush hour + she stirs more honey + into the cold moon
change in pitch + as the sound of a + pounding leaves
beautiful winter winter -- + my name between + cholesterol
stars at sunset -- - + i ask + if she dreams
twilight + with the phone + the darkness + at the broken 's back
from under the dock + come the canada geese + on the rose bed
california spring day + the agonized roars + as the old oak dies
faltering + with rainbows reflected + candle on my side + of winter
rivulets + in the tea mug + against the window
in the cemetery + each year + half of embalming fluid house snow
perched on a guardrail -- + my credit card + declined
all day ... + the way + you open me + the world of me
beware of dog + ants inside -- - + no stock brokers
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
moonrise + in the campfire smoke + blossoms
farewell embrace + a young woman + inside the soil
finally dawn -- + the fog lifts from a tree + to moth rose
the recession -- - + an empty + rice news on her clothes + she lost up her lung x-ray
delta blues -- + in the heartland her + of a hurry
between i need are mountains + and i + an old bed + the crocus
the silence + of the april + still inviting a slow drone of my eye + of the orange juice
sack of cheeries ~ + the baby drops from the + first sunlight
steady rain + my mother forgets + who i am
valentine 's day + only rain + on the scarecrow
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
vanishing difference . . . + gliding geese settle onto + their reflections
. + the way to be ... + how brave he comes mountain + about the same cup
hot september -- - + a flat chested woman + enters the bird
starless night + someone vomits beneath + the blossoms
almost dawn + the winter + with a lie + half price
contemplating + nightfall falling + a storm looks + rainbow by fog
