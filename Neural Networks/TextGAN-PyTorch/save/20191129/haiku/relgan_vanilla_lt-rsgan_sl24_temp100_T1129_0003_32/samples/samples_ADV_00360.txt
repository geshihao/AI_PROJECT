sudden + left unopened— + a winter moon + on the bedroom wall + in the sky
waiting for the bus + the last whistle of a dog barks + to the sunset
sunny morning sea— + the dog + left out of her night + new shores
half way across + why rush past + the same song + the hands tearing shrimp
at the breakfast + with one cat + on the bay .
dry light + the rain + at the blue sky + the silence + that of the roses
spring chill— + the moonlight + inside the skin + to the friend
november night + the rain + at the sidewalk cafe + half moon
heavy rain + christmas lights + bleed in a puddle + in the sky
change in pitch + as i the sound + of a heat wave
spring + the moon + on the sky + a rain a cup + of your kiss
autumn rain + a bunch of daffodils + against the brick wall + in the sky
zen garden + after each storm + from the computer keyboard + the old photo
the underside + of lawnmowers + the scent + of rain
late winter + dreaming + my and breaks + but shine + two fingers of scotch
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + in the sky
through the edge + of the fog + at every old feet + a grows 's window
the carpet + is wearing thin + silence
spring storm— + a wave + of the path
the space + between etched names ... + war cenotaph + autumn snow
a break in the wind + the scent + of asphalt
woodsmoke over my tea + the warmth + of the sky
through the willows -- + tiny flower of + the night 's last
the underside + of lawnmowers + a white cloud + of one last
early spring + everything + dripping
the sound + of the first fallen leaf + a sweet sigh + hospice window
twilight + the fog makes the dead + the computer screen + a in the sea
a butterfly + the plane + slice our silence + on the asphalt
late winter + my office couch + a last drops + on the road
a sudden moon + the tree i left + for the pony 's cry
grey surrounds + wind blows + to the car 's end + a glimmer of a + nuzzles the hand
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than the photograph
