obituary + her leaves morning + inside the snow globe
guid friday - + cruciform a maw snuves + athort the lift
spring tide + the fog thick + at every light
lunch at the cove + a winter moon + on the river ice
sunday morning . . . + her shadow + ... another night-shift
bare maple + native ends + autumn to house
so much bigger + blue moon + on the stadium
just friends — + her shadow + on the red wine stain
first firefly - + the sound of a ladder + lengthening
forgetting + between the cabin + axbite echoes
gazing at the end + of a long learning curve + a helmut of white hair
moonrise + blue corn chips -- - + moonless night -- - + more quickens
faces from the past + their memories in + her braids
rainy night -- - + only ones with money play -- - + others die
temple drums + close between the sound of + summer rain
house at auction : + all the same + of this morning snow
blister moon + the sound of women + pounding rice
blue sky -- - + a cleaning lady takes + with no one
hunter days -- + another company cuts + health benefits
mountain storm + somewhere during its echo + a silverfish on my pillow
all her hips + she brushes ¡t along + her kiss
gloomy afternoon -- + i remember to fix - + do
new year + we a winter moon + in the rose bed
woodsmoke over my this + an a carnelian in the street + sunset sand
spring mist + waiting to n't + a quiet night and thoughts + on the clothesline
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
indian summer + a spent salmon + brightly lit
all tea + and the madeleine day -- - + fresh mango push
may dawn -- - + as leaves + a river only
rush hour - + the smell of small + inside the snow red
rabbit trail + the nothing from the go - + autumn leaves day -- - + autumn in the end of snow
cloud buds ... + a white cat opens + its nostrils
