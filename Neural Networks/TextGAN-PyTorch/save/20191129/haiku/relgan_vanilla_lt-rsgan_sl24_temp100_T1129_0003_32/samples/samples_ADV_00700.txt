early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + her silence
the blank page + learning nothing + on the pine
first time + after the noon + the tree i passed + in your razor
first end + a blackbird tears + with one small + new summer 's feet
new year 's eve -- + the christmas + inside the sky
the page-finders + of my father ’ s daily missal + losing their colors
close lightning + the metallic taste + in the old cat + first sunlight + first , old back ,
one by my childhood -- + after a cow + its tune light
harsh sunlight + faces peep the bars + of the police van
first time . . . + autumn equinox + after the fly + till it disappears
equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , + across of snow
a tiny world + unfolds and thrives - + an empty mind + full of her homeland
hot mist + the hint of the height marks + on the incense + to the autumn wind
after an storm + the candle + at the clouds + new a rain + a day moon
the snow -- + after many walk + the night 's last
as the train passes + graffiti murals + across old .
year 's end + of the twelve-carriage platform + a storm and + full of the night
no work today + the carpenter ant wanders + aimlessly
spring mist + the same earth + waiting waiting of + the night has
spring mist + the tree i take + into the scent + of rain
withered peony + her love story + after menopause
leap year + looking at midnight -- - + no stock brokers + a river man
between the yoga + and chi gung classes -- + wind through the willows + to an old photo
anniversary— + the top + of the fence + her grocery shadow + passes me
while washing spinach + how nice to find + a haiku there + winter solstice
dead leaves + caught for the night + a light in in the city + summer 's end
the underside + of lawnmowers + the scent + of rain
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the last + still the sky
concert under + the crowns of the redwoods + of wearing you + fireflies
a sudden chill -- + a bit of volcanic ash + in the winter coat
autumn mist + the last drops + as the news of a + changes everything
farmwife + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
