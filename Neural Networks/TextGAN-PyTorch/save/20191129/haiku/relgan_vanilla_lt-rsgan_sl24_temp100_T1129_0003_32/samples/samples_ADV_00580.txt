the haze lifts + from the trees + a rain + from the front wheel
holy day + the agonized roars + as the old oak + from the old house
june day + the crowns + of the cherry blossom + on the hot wind
what thing cries + to the morning mist + the blackbird with too old + father is the morning

the silence + the many scent + of rain
