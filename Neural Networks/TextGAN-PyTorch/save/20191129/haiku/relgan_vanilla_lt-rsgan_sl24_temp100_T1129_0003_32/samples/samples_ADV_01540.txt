blistering heat + about silence + in the new snow
close lightning + my a blackbird tears flesh + from the ripe cherry
calling to + street sparrows + a caged bird summer
slice by slice + in the sheperds + spring evening power day -- - + my shadow
failed copy + the real iris bluer + than the photograph
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
doing the dishes - + a tiny soap bubble rises + toward heaven
autumn equinox -- + a forgotten bale + of contrails
cold snap -- + my train arrives + in the car 's headlights
breakup — + the swallows feed + on both sides
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat + first more holds up the news to
heartwood + a dampness in the washing + washing window
in the child + points news + the tea kettle + silenced
autumn equinox -- + a last of the road + of his
almost dawn -- + all that dirty laundry + sorted by the roses
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
bitter wind + fragments of conversation + drift from the sea breeze
brush + my mother ’ s hair + in the wind
january walk + santa claus and a flag + with one
mother 's day + a stop of hearts on the floor + of the compartment
the snow falls + on the branch of rain + at the end of the sea
fine shell new + with a text + april rain
sunset morning -- - + all that line + the side lane + in the dust
leap year + looking for the window + at the end + a glimmer of light
cold snap -- + a birthday reminder + on the pond
moonrise -- + the wind blows sand + to study the air
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + in the old house
traffic at sunset -- - + she stands + by my feet
lake ice + the few spots of red + first robins snow
early spring spring -- - + she 's lost + in the autumn wind
the moon + each spoonful + of a gull + ... homeless
abandoned farmhouse + the quiet bedroom where i open + feared the dark
