a bone scan today + on the prison compound + spring rain
how some things end— + onion flakes + on the table
equinox -- - + another star appears + in the sky ?
today again + a shooting star beneath + she of it 's rain
april warmth- + a young essence + of mothballs
brush + is dipped deeper + than the rain come and me + from the sea
day moon -- - + umbrellas + go to work
after the party + of lawnmowers + a scent of rain
your reflection + floating in its back , + summer rain
all her day -- - + i tell my barber do something + about the sky
alongside time for something + slippery in the ocean + under the stars
house at auction : + all the lawn ornaments + autumn rain
mothers ' + dragonflies after + the coffee cup + stage it out
an orange and pink sky - + the sound of a heat + nuzzles my hand ...
anniversary— + a few weeds + its heart too noise
almost dawn + a small crack in the thick + fishing boats come in
january walk + santa claus and a flag + a winter moon
may dawn ... + pines + etched 's passing
sleeping late + running down the end + of a snail trail + the wheel trail
cold snap + not sharing + in the falling leaves
mountain storm + somewhere during its echo + the thunder ends
logging road— + the pileated woodpecker + flings its back , + winter dusk
gloomy afternoon -- - + the sound of a long + broken promises
late winter - + copper wishes collect + in the bottom of my purse + free day
early spring + everything + dripping
into dusk + the only window + autumn equinox
farmwife + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
dawn haze + the nobody i + into my computer screen
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on fire
overcast day -- - + a beach beauty goes + topless
from under the kid + the way + you open me
abandoned farmhouse + a yellowed grocery list taped + for the full moon
