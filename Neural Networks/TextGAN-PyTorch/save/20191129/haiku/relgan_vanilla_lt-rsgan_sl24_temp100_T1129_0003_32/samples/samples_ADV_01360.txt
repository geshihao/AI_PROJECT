between sunrise + the last horse heartbeat + on the friend
her hips + sway our debate on sex + summer heat + at the window
unexpected guest- + the way + lifting fog
the trees + around the campfire + she tells the white + first smile
first day + my wife pregnant + at the north window + a in law
my ford explorer + the muscles in my back + unknot
spring mist + the tree i walk through + the firework smoke + a sun tan
starless night -- + my favorite pub loses + above the moon
new year + a warm morning -- - + christmas songs + in the roses
all i need are mountains + and i slow healing + my cold morning
hearing the call + of the axe blade + on the blue wave
almost dawn -- + all that cups + an old last leaves lights + in the sky
winter solstice + candle too short + this butterfly
the crunch + of many women + cicadas of blue irises
open window + the landscape coming + to the cooling tower box + a spring morning and moon
forever waiting + for the ring of the phone + watching the rain
almost dawn + the night separating from the + blue sky
questions + purl like schools of fish + the apple + first child 's laughter
an orange and pink sky . . . + my hand + from the city interrupted
tired new mom - + brown leaves + falling from the green trees
hot september -- - + at the end i + a moth 's heat + at the pond
superbowl sunday -- + my hands recalling + this we grass
some ago + the poor woman 's axe + gleams brightly lit
where do + the dark horse + with one a friend + then the sky
may dawn -- + all parking lots + this autumn night
keep an eye open + the winter moon + on the fuselage
superbowl sunday -- - + another dawn + at the moon
night shift -- + a quick break up + on christmas tea
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
slipping in + beneath the kitchen door + -first sunlight
dark days of winter + another mailbox loses + to the snowplow
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
