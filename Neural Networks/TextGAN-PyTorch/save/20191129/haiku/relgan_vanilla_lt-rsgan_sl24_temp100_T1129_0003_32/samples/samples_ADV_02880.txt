breakup — + on the counter + lighting the moon just on
decorating my cell again + her hair + to the black top
almost dawn + a drunk in the middle of the table + first snow -- -
questions + purl like schools of fish + in dangerous waters
dinner at sunset -- - + she stands + get smaller
dentist 's office + the last whistle of + a train whistle
blog your nails + to my autumn + of the night river hour
campfire coffee + she turns the young + of an empty garden
half moon + halfway through the book open + a winter moon
walking to work - + under a black woman + essence of the earth
stillness . . . + pages lap + through the garden stones + the winter skies
enlightment -- + a police car + in the fire
amish train -- + those little - + autumn leaves day
early spring -- + yellow flower + bends i
spring fever + tree roots cracking - + budding hands -- - + autumn afternoon
crowded championship + it starts with me + like the rose
high tide + yesterday 's death + only rain
mayflowers + three small boys + in the wind
this road + the twists and turns + in the green grass
sudden shower + cursing the umbrella + and the pines
cold breakfast + warm again - + starvation 's pall
waning moon -- + forgetting of the ancestors + between dawn
desert wind + with the phone ring + a cold moon
sunday morning -- - + she asks + who picked our lilacs
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + of a candle 's door ...
blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
mothers ' + the sound of a horse galloping + into the text
almost dawn -- + all that of the + forest fire
splatting drops + the little earth + in the wind
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
first pussy willows -- - + two dogs sniff each other + to the middle of cooking
watermelon rind , + sitting in its own juice + the summer sun
