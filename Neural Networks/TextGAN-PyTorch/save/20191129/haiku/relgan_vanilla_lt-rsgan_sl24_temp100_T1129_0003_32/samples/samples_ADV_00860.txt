in the net + the train graffiti drips + autumn rain
at the lawn concert + lighting one spot at a time- + fireflies
a sudden chill -- + a bit + lost in the cold clouds + new moon
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stars ... + a white butterfly
new year fireworks + in the campfire smoke + old memories
into dusk + the same earth + waiting waiting + from the pine of stars
almost spring + the shopkeeper burns incense + to drive passes me + autumn evening
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
in the cold spring + from the cooling tower + sunrise
blind date + her face + on the family window
new year + fireworks + the trail of my day + a day 's wife
her dreams + but there you are + a homeless man warms himself + hand to the line
the curved woman + with its grey hair + in the wind + the spring in the
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
summer sunset -- + a smiling of the dog + over the valley
the blank page + learning nothing + to our tombstones + a than the clouds
church bells + she turns in the wall + looks wider
wind chime + my new jacket + spring evening rain
the memory + of suburban + a sweet scent + of my eucalyptus
crowded subway -- + the red island + a train window
ants in the wall + between my fingers + the smell of leaves + a drink
hot chocolate + my neighbour bag + at the scent + of fog
he looks at + my new dahlias too + a deer storm + on the morning moon
house + i change + the patter of raindrops + on the pine of loneliness
sunday morning + smells of french toast + and cinnamon ... + summer rain
alone + the mailman + left burning on the road + reappears
indian summer + the sweeping + from the graveyard + old shoes
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
autumn equinox + i peel a red onion + in running water in
a window frames + the rain has erased + all the marks -- my wind + in the sky
cloudy + with its grey hair + in the wind + a heat wave
death + on the river iris + in the marsh + unreachable
