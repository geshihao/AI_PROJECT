anniversary— + a few weeds + at the wind
lakeside + the fog makes the loon 's call + much more haunting
late winter solstice + candle too much + for the stars
change in pitch + a fence post + almost his date
green rimmed eye + and chi gung classes -- + scent of burning sage
new year + fireworks + in the misty sky -- - + a new moon
how some things end— + onion flakes + on the market sack
barn owl ’ s cry : + the darkness + pierced with wounds
working saturday - + a dead bowl + of imported ale
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
november tea + another just behind + citibank skyscraper
filtering in + i peel a star + an old leaf again + into autumn geese
questions + purl like schools of fish + a yellow butterfly + then the potter
in the early trees + a steady spring snow + on the blue moon
briefly + the phone cord + stage a riot
my stillness - + all the quilts + still at the cleaners
a chill -- - + my neighbor prays + in the rain
contemplating + nightfall falling on the river + spider webs and plastic bags + catch the morning light
spring - + cormorants sparrows + on the blue moon
early spring snow + snow on the main stem + of the rose bed + a scent of jasmine
midday heat + the morning starts + without me + in the spider 's fog
spring mist + my neighbour asks me + on his side of his mouth + ... another night-shift
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
past midnight + all day long + broken promises
midnight night - + an old man towels + himself in the sunlight
bitter wind + fragments of conversation + drift another
change in pitch + as leaves the train starts + the fingers of the brewery
walking to work - + the blossoms on my street + late this year
coffee rings + with a black + at the phone screen + day a heat wave
standing stock-still : + in the tea bag + in the halal silence
forest , a sermon + on a sermon of a sermon + of perfume
midday heat + a faint breeze from + a winter moon
