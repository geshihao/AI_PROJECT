blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
spring morning + the silence beyond + the streetlight
despite the day + we the lingering + scent of rain
spring gale + raindrops on the raw wood + moonlight through rain
drunk on the beach- + the rain + in the sea
autumn rain + the slow drone of a plane + coming in to land
just friends — + a taste of summer + in the cat 's cry
crystal night + the tree i know + he we never know
the underside + of lawnmowers + the scent + of rain
a room + endless rain + from the sky
slow men picketing + a chevy agency + a child asks , `` parade ? ''
train whistle . + palm prints linger + against the glass
head cold - + the grey dawn + cooking
ripened tomatoes— + the last colour + the faint time pane
i brush + my mother ’ s hair + the sparks
indian summer + the sweeping + the stillness
above + the sun strikes + still some things right + winter dusk
spring mist + the tree i take shelter under + her braids
restless dreams + but there you are + on the sidewalk
starry night— + biting into a melon + full of seeds
your reflection + floating in the tea + the rain
( beach + a street light still + on the asphalt
summer -- + another beach boys tune + speaks 's over
spring mist + the scent stronger + this cold night
despite the day + my silence + a crying baby
call the traffic + ants inside -- + the wind blows + to a white butterfly
blue sky + the silence + left through the girl + you turned
corn on the cobb— + my husband complains again + of coon tracks
dawn -- + the monologue + of every tree
winter sky -- + the chapel two hours darker + for vespers
winter + the silence + of the sun in the + sunshine the sidewalk + full with stars
campfire coffee + the makeup cry + of poppy child
