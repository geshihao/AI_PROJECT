on the hill + and chi gung classes -- + the wind + still new
the page-finders + the taste + of rain
november night + the dog + left burning his as + so we tulips + he left at me
scent + of a snail buddha + first water on the highway + the tip of his eyes + follow a snowflake
between + silent construction + the light of the house + a cigarette butt
new year + the calicantus morning + the morning sun + an old man + wears the bare to the hose
close lightning + the metallic taste + in the old cat + a river man
the wind + the echo of a cuckoo + the silence night + new moon
rain + the moon + and a dry + on an egret 's wall
march winds + the scent + of unknown flowers + a hot rain
waiting for + a fried tune + the full moon shines + a clouds
a break in the sun + the sun strikes + the cockscomb â€™ s red
late winter + the silence + of the blue sky + the silence between us
spring + the train graffiti + a rain + a clouds
almost dawn + the night separating + a day moon
autumn rain + the landscape coming + to the rose bed + a flock of stars
my tea gets colder + the last glimmering + of oystercatchers
a curve in the road + looking for lilacs + the snow grows
winter + between the yoga + my small world + on the ground
all saints morning + the first stars + a winter moon
beyond darkened fields , + the winter killed grass + a swan 's whiteness
sudden rain + of the ancient -- + a brightness to find + the sky
away + the smell + of summer heat + with the world + of snow
a furniture store + where the church used + to the fire
dawn -- + black + his dogs last shadow + on the table
all sunlight + mist trailing + over the autumn mist + the lie
herding + the stronger now + the homeless scent + and honey
city traffic + a winter moon + on the rose bed + the autumn rain
blue dawn + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold + under the moon
new year + the calicantus morning + at the park sign + smell of the green grass
into dusk + the fog makes the lights + a rose
day the moon + the last ball + subway in the tea
