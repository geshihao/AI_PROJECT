fireworks show + an explosion of color + crosses empty falling on the door + to front gate
mountain storm + somewhere during its echo + a butterfly in hand
my tea gets colder + between my fingers + between us
autumn rain + fallen on bare earth + the sound of crickets , + back to the loon ?
sunrise -- - + a yogi does + her cancer meds
midnight + with the first scent + fluttering in the sound + summer heat
the old woman + with its back + ... the same + a chair them
early spring -- + one chickadee + louder than the rest + leans to another
office window + comings ... + old warriors
strategic plan - + old man + sunshine the sidewalk + at her window
rush hour + a light in the basement + in my beer cart
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + across the wall
frosty night + another wish + goes on their list on the window + a winter cup
just friends — + a taste of summer + without a her last rain + then i follow them down
high winds + she smiles at the end + of a fan-tailed one
summer evening + crescents of cantaloupe + on the cold morning + with my computer
all saints morning + a path + of trodden leaves
looking up + a fried egg + in the cat 's cry
november -- + we boys + in the wind
cold snap + a quiet room in + the smell of snow + on the gin bottles
change in pitch + as i sketch the wind + more brightly lit
arizona + road stop rest , + highway on the bayou
perched of + the soft silence + of april snow
working saturday -- - + the sound of distant + foghorns
end of an affair— + the ligustrum tree + no inside -- - + autumn for sunset
grey today + the waves rush + to the car door
moonless night -- + pulling the dog + on an empty
open window + she brings his urn + by first spring + summer 's end
thunderstorms + each spoonful + a taste of summer + a clean slate
thunder clouds + on the branch the sparrows + tighter and tighter -- - + that conversations
winter drizzle + all the heat + with no one geese + the last late evenings
