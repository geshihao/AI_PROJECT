back home + the same earth + waiting waiting
+ an old rolodex + in the old temple + after her needle -- + sunshine the wind
loon calls + my mother forgets + a street light still - + autumn rain
the page-finders + of a newborn + inside the old house -- - + a petals on the table
autumn mist + after the frog + on the horse â€™ s + at the stars
night shift -- + a quick break up + on the christmas ornaments
farmwife from + moon rises + the light in my street + sunset
all saints morning + her pink scarf + the morning trail
almost dawn + the night separating from the + first frost
no work today + she buys new + colour contacts
the wind + lily petals + frozen cranes take + spring evening
distant temple drums + close + near the floating + down the mountain
sudden rain -- + a brightness from + what might have been lost
humid night + the farm + left behind and copper
sudden spring showers + in the wheatfield + a little of snow + ... cool
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + on the red wine
into dusk + the morning mist + of falling
long ago + the threw + and blooming + on the fly
left by simmer + the kettle shrieks + until answered
this morning + firecracker papers + wander the streets
snowmelt . + the haiku poet 's mind . . . + elsewhere
dark days + another me + of the night no one
sudden rain + puddles fill falling + inside the snow red
between + silent construction + the silence beyond + the streetlight
four am ~ + across now + in the sheperds eyes + over cold champagne
almost dawn + the night separating from the + first frost
to the finland station + the king of hearts on the + first robins light
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the last page + a white butterfly
dew + at twilight -- + scent of damp burning -- her + uncombed hair
slow come and my daughter starts -- + a child 's hand + new address home
