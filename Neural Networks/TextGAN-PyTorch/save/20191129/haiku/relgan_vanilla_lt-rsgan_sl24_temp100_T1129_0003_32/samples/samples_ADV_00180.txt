june moon + the smell of my mother + stoops the kitchen way
autumn mist + the sun in the dust + a parking spot
hot beach sand + between the night + longer
after-party + we blow out candles + in the wind
winter morning + a coffee + graffiti + autumn in spring
new year + the calicantus ' + the morning -- + the winter moon
a spider 's heat + the sikh shopkeeper + opens later than usual
mother 's day + the flowers have long faded + on the rain
rush hour + a light in the basement + and no one
hot day + the wet maple leaf sticks + to the mattress
the recession -- - + he only the graffiti + on wall street
a single leaf falling + opens and closes the shutters + windy day
early spring + the minty freshness + of his kiss
the ides + of a hot gumbo + for the old pond
as the train passes + the tree i + out the canyon mouth + spring sky
between lace curtains + the white cat 's + the river buddha
autumn bonfire – + a flock + of rain
hot beach sand + tree slowly + this autumn day
into dusk + the dog 's sharp 's rose + a scent + of melon
my father 's hammer + warm again + an empty block moon
wakes another + dragonflies escape from + the slow rise of fireflies
a dull ache + settles deep winter still + a winter rain
a flurry of snow + the mother ’ s hair + the young man
the silence + the many green scent + ... in the cold feet
blood on barbed wire + a pale moon + reveals the crime
to my smartphone + mount fuji in the sunset + a cup of burning
silent flight + the flowers have long faded + yet we remember
new year + fireworks + the first time
sunday morning . . . + the rush hour + this autumn day
autumn mist + i let the requiem + begin
the slow healing + the landscape coming + to a stop
traffic drums + the scars + of his healings
