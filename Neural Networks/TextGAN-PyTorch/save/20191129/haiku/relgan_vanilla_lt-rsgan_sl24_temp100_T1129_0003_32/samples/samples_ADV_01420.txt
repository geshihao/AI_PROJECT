through the window + half a mirror showing + a quarter room
new year + fireworks + the dog 's smell + of my brown morning light
ripened tomatoes— + a used condom + into the night
meditating and + resplendent in sunlight + into the night 's + in the clouds
clothes dried + my daughter drawing circles + near the fire
raking the leaves ~ + wind blows + on the same 's fog
spring mist + the tree i take shelter under + planted in remembrance
a pagoda + in the wood of elder trees + blow of wind
through the memory + of suburban + still the earth night
clacking rails + five languages + in the compartment
standing stock-still : + in the cold spring + a winter sun
deep autumn ; + the tea leaves + with the funeral
rainy night -- + after a hot seashell + an unlocked cream cart
all saints morning + fog + on the last streetlight
gas station + and i make what i passed + in your red 's morning out
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the rain . . .
sudden rain -- + all the shadows + of the lupine 's morning light
death watch + the egret shifts + with mist
unknotting + the hammock ropes + her braids
the rail tracks + toward a harvest moon + thoughts and shoes
almost dawn + the white cat + on side of steam
typhoon passed -- + a in hours the -- + my cancer
rivulets + the oil + spring weeds + towards the front wheel + a of lunar dust
all his , the day -- + endless tv ads + for her
cloudy + a faint essence + of rain
darkening trees + few fire-flies + on a foggy window + my comment
darkening trees + the steady shrilling + of cicadas
almost dawn + a small crack in the thick + left by the snowmelt
beneath + the window buddha + first water ...
reoccurrence + of cancer -- - + a harvest moon + wrapped with clouds
soft rain + few leaves circle + in the headlights
independence day— + the tea leaves . . . + and then i to see my child + to her morning light
