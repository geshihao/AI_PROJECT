november afternoon + the child in the ocean + the dog sniffs + my shadow
sunrise -- + i follow the table + on the dock seagulls + a white cloud
first firefly + the way + lifting , + the same yard + the scent
clear clouds + the rain at the river window + the sound of hammering + summer 's end
sudden rain + the heavy weight + a date + smiles at me
darkening wind + the child on her voice + after my comment
dawn + the fog thick + with rain
from under the dock + the old violin + of the robin 's bucket
grey light + the monologue + of blue tree
spring cleaning + a garden + summer tea -- + the milky way
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in her hymnal
spring + her pink scarf + the lingering + are afternoon + morning sky
spring morning + fog + into the pond + the smell of the soup + a glimmer roses
my mother cries + the frozen pond + his light + a rainbow
blue sky + the silence + on the gin welder + a baby 's cry
seed catalog + the colours + of a dead ’ s + losing their colors
blizzard + the silence + the child 's tomb + reflects the sky
far from wall + a white barn + the blackbird moon
wakes the last girl + a white rose + still whiter
on the pavement + the sound of a heat + shaking itself + to the night river
spring mist + the tree i take shelter under + planted the station wall
last light + the landscape + the winter moon + on the fuselage
november night + a stone into the pond + sprinklings of moon
an orange and pink sky + the silence + left standing
early spring + the minty freshness + of the first fallen leaf + a petals river
the silence + the child 's marble bag + the morning light in the box + of the first time
another birthday— + watching the long ash + on the incense
on the pavement + a plane + coming in the mist + the blackbird
the underside + of lawnmowers + the last day + of a loon 's face
the path shorter + the silence + in the night air + is the night
twilight + the fog + over the bay fills + a wait left
sunset + the shopkeeper burns + the tip + of silence
