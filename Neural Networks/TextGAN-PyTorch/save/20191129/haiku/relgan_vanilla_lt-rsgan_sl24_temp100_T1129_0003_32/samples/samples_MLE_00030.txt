january warms + white breaths + in the garden
falling leavesâ€” + leaves fall from dead + one a haiku
cold weather + dreaming of the monsoon + in the attic
machine . . . + a few notes higher and words + beyond the sun arm
a plane 's landing today + bent like the old temple closer + across
the blank dawn -- - + new graffiti + morning day
new frost air + through the window + in my eyes
scent of seaweed + ... the have , the clouds
darkening morning + the gap + the spring sun
a rainy june downpour takes cold break + my breath on the bayou
distant thunder of a day + our thin ... hameless + the scent of yellow rose
ceiling wave off + the old in wall street + through tears
spring sunshine - + a friend whistle + cuts the dog ticks
autumn melancholy + we pull my moon
this mountain ridge + close by + this third 's song open
melting tar + silk foot persimmon
sunday morning . . . + another drunk pisses + from dawn
hazy skies + i make to the rain + a magpie 's calls
between last station + and warm air merge + down day
news of the rain : + watching the passing . . . + two shells
wooden no cold + the slow by the codfish road + her reflection
house on his snow + against the morning prayers + without moonlight
cloudy autumn day -- + one watering can cards + all day long day
repeating the spent firework of road + the slow ticking
groundhog day + on one firefly down + plum blossom rain
sacred path shorter now + doors in the car
rain just you + through an air air + shades of cover
sunday home 's warmth + a new crop of dandelions + against my window
croton hedges + halfway through the many site + support trees
memorial morning -- + the dog finds dead way + to dream room
everything view + photo where the sea + to watch the candle
church barn ~ + the joy of the cracks + the thunder
