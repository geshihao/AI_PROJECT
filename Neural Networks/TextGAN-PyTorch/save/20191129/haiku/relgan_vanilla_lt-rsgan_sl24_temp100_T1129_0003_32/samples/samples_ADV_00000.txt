on the town -- + the rain storm + at a line of traffic traffic + a white rose
autumn woods + all my things + and i left
deep fog - + the sound of a woodpecker + shifts again
a soda can + shot full moon to the sky - + a poster of crickets
june moon - + no one feet one + in the garden
my ford explorer + on a never-ending quest + for the parking spot
desert cemetery- + my sister in law + does not weep
. . . . + the tree i know + in my rose
the scarecrow + covered , a black + a bee 's weight
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on wall street
roadside puddle + finally he comes out + as the silence
as old reflection + lost and in the hum + of summer rain
to the finland station + the king of hearts on the floor + of the compartment
moonless night + too many stars + at the sidewalk cafe
sudden fog -- - + an elixir of cherry blossoms + and moonlight
zen garden + a magpie turns in the lake + in his kiss
hot chocolate + my neighbour bag + still wrapped
one by one + fireflies escape my glass jar ... + starry fireworks
he looks at her dreams + but there you are + in the mountain man
just friends â€” + a taste of summer + slowly my
splatting drops + after a noon - + no sunset
summer rain . . . + remembering + still inviting bees
concert in full flow ... + my darkness her bare trees + on the garden
autumn equinox + the fallen leaf + half-green , half-gold
tai chi -- - + after so many + the ac gets
where do + the dark horse + with a clouds
summer stars . . . + to old bedroom + but moonlight
moving cold + dreaming + my pursues i thunder
erosion day + the moon breaks through + her nth unanswered call
drunk and the river wind + a morning sun in the eyes + over the rose
he looks at the sun + after many eyes + the morning night
the path shorter now , + underfoot the crumbling leaves ; + the child runs ahead
