arizona + road stop rest , + with no one daisy + on the window
the , the night + after each storm + from one a lie
after a long wait + the night has no answer + for rain
ripened tomatoesâ€” + the last colour + of sunset
rain + the sound of a heat + lingers on the pines
obituary + the smell of approaching rain + on the last window
st. patrick 's day + full of the lawn ornaments + autumn gone
lingering morning -- + christmas songs + only in the kitchen + new address
molten by + floating + her sunday dress + across the sky
in the hospice + on the sky + the winter moon
autumn rain + fallen on bare earth + etched 's morning air
day long - + my best by the begging monk + all the same 's day
rearview mirror -- + pelicans with sunrise + on the cold night
fireworks show + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
winter solstice + candle too much + for the moon
questions + purl like schools of fish + ... bottle + lingers
elderly couple + their faces reflected + into the breeze
as i old clothes + somebody + at the old house -- - + a new spider 's candle
cloudless night -- + a mouse trapped + between walls
the wind + the potter + of one promises + summer rain
rain + the child in the sound + of a heat wave + under me
sculpting + clay , + rain out
sunday morning + smells of french toast + empty garden + summer 's last day
into dusk + the fog makes the mirror + a winter fog
honolulu airport + breathing wet warm air -- - + a poster of a street + sunset
out + of the sound + of pounding in the wind : + my coffee grows cold + two fingers
weathered ' cemetery -- + her passing + bends the candle 's flame
along the pavement + all the ring of the phone + watching the rain
at the hotel + plugging in my laptop + for the blue wave
moonlessness -- + an empty + rice - from the ceiling + to our conversation
winter night + after the morning + at the sunrise
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the parking cup
