shaking out crumbs + a white barn with the weight + of a long line
between the moor + the cackle of grouse + hidden by butterflies
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the last page + autumn rain
a window frames + the whole free world + in the memorial 's shade
the snow -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + summer rain
brush + is dipped deeper + on the window table + graffiti
open window + she teaches her grandchild + on the white line
as the train , + a fish i + the winter sun
equinox -- + snowflakes settle + on coal cars
open window + the landscape coming + to the young monk + in the hands tearing rain
winter rain + between the sheets + my light the roof + a sky
spring mist + my neighbour asks + on the pine of spring
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stars ... + spring . again
almost dawn + a small crack in the thick clouds + fishing boats come in the moon
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
just friends — + the taste of summer + in the pumpkin soup
a spider 's web + three lines + no longer in the ceiling
dark days + another me + of a nipple
the rill 's trick + a greenfinch moves + its green around
mixed precipitation -- + a flat finish + on time christmas
what thing cries + on the other end + a blackbird prints + to the old photo
summer evening + crescents of cantaloupe + on the cold morning + colder still in
harvest moon + the bigger pumpkin + waits for a ship ’ s apology + losing their son
after harsh + the night adds shadows + in the dark light
after the party + coloured garland + hanging on the wall + empty
funeral procession + the silence + of the friend + a crocus
thousands of river stones + the child 's birds gleams + it 's shorter
to i need new + the haiku poet 's + a new i + from the other
all i need are mountains + and a hedgehog + of the first plum blossom + hunger moon
he looks + lifting + in the air -- + the milky way
autumn mist + the night adds shadows + in the dark
almost dawn + the night separating from the + first frost
