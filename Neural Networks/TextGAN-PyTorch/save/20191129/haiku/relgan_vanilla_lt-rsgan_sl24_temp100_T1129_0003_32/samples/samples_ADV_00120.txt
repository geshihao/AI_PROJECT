mountain ground + a bumblebee tastes + every poppy
wildfire haze + a too lights + at the end
the ides + of a hot gumbo + for the old pond
winter wind— + sound of a skill saw + the winter morning sun
moon gazing + fogging up + the waiting of love locks + two pink-haired girls
sudden spring showers + the honking of canada geese + that morning out the window
early morning -- + my mother 's + rice paper skin
chrysanthamums + the homeless girl pulls + her baby closer
cold snow + the silence beyond + the streetlight
hunter 's moon -- + her braids + on the salt day
at the hotel + plugging in the laptop + for the lie + half price
this road + the twists and turns + in the green grass
the ides + of a hot mirror + a walk interrupted
between the yoga + and chi gung classes -- + scent of burning sage
old garden chair -- + a winter moon + to the crime
from under the dock + a lizard 's ribs pressed + through the hand dusk
the wind brings + scent of mimosa + among the aerials
a float plane + divides the canada geese + the end of the marks + on wall street
day long rain + the greengrocer stacks cabbages + on cabbages
just friends — + the sun in the + forest fire
death watch ended + the long sound + of a homeless man
spring mist + the tree i take shelter under + the old apple lights
friday the 13th -- + my aunt corrects + the shape of his life
flight by snow + the asylum seeker + thoughts on the land
early spring + pallets of fertilizer + on the loading dock
all saints + we tired + her braids
all saints morning + . . . . + morning in the end + a day moon
friday . . . + the way the oncologist + says `` i follow ... do
the underside of leaves + women smile + without the day
cold snap + the refrigerator freezes + the lettuce
the birthday -- + that song slowly + a sun tan
news + my mother 's + mirror
