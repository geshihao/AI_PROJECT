valentine 's day + the only bright + in the sky
late winter snow + the silence + between the april rain + free day
zen garden + after my a storm + opens the closes + an egret playing + her braids
the offering + on the front yard + in the autumn wind + the blackbird elm
dark days + another , + what i planted too old + morning fog
in the + steppingstone + leaves leaves + a winter moon
a second glass + the morning + still at the end + of the world + of who
a sudden chill -- + the silence + of a damselfly + kite festival
even rain + and i slow down + this autumn day + my new year 's eve light
the december + finding an old flame + on facebook
lightning + far away + the old tombstone + keeps watch
cold saturday + a small + for no one has + left by the night
new year + the calicantus morning + with my silver tin + left by the calendar
a spider 's web + three saffron-robed birds + in the rain geese
fields + at dawn + a single leaf falling + on the salt snow
new year + the calicantus ' + the morning + in the clouds
death + the house + painting + a moon + and wind
scenting + a young woman + inside the lights + of her needle -- + the milky way
day + the agonized roars + as the sunflowers + with one stones + a wait for lilacs
after heavy + her light + the morning + still me by a morning + new year 's eve
a spider + brimming with mountains— + trout ripple the last + changes lit
sudden rain + a too after + the firework smoke + this path
cold news + in the tea mug + against the window + a soldier 's mother 's face
midnight + with the lights + over the campfire + blue of it
the slow healing + the snow + new names + and a hedgehog + when it 's a garden
subway transfer + the homeless lady + sells mirrors
i brush + my mother ’ s hair + the sparks
smoke morning + the silence beyond + the streetlight
a construction + the dark horse + with a dead friend + on the calendar
death watch + the scent + of asphalt + the hand
your reflection + floating in a tea cup + too hot to drink + hospice window
air + a rabbit hops + across the busy street
