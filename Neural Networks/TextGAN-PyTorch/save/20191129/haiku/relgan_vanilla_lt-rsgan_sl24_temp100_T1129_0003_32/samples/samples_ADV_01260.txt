my son 's birthday + the rabbit hops + across old path
independence day— + the crows chatter muffled + by silence
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter moon
the underside of + gentians blooming + goes on the wall + lengthening
under the + the sky and hollow + with the roses
he looks + lifting + in the blue sky -- + a mouse in hand
almost + around our a a circles + by his day
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls from the stars ...
humid morning -- + my daughter drawing the sound + of a homeless man
between the yoga + and chi gung classes -- + wind through the new + the deep light
after the funeral + whiskers + on the blue iris
all the mardi gras colors + in the masks + in the houses
almost dawn + the night separating from the + frost etchings
spring mist + the tree i + attention span
harmonica player + blue irises + late rain + on the green grass
last light + the landscape coming + to the young monk + on the fly
november night -- + a faint scent + of rain
play in + the unfamiliar path + inside the light
summer rain + the space between us + filling with on the stone buddha
strawberry friday + after the noon + the last leaves on the last + forest fire
morning haze -- - + the ups guy knocks + a in the clouds
over monday coffee + the conversation of a + changes back in the eye + autumn rain
into dusk + the only window + for food , gas leaves ... + a wave of barking + sweeps the neighbourhood
sudden fog -- + a second passes me + hat less
lightning at window + soft rain + a pale moon + reveals the crime
beware of dog + ants inside -- - + i start + it tastes the same
gazing with thunder— the + steppingstone ends off + autumn gone
deepening snow -- + two boys + still falling
splatting drops + the little buddha + bisected infinity
the page-finders + of a winter sugar + hand at my window
november snow -- - + she pencils + in the bird 's fog
humid morning -- + that of a lie + without blinking
