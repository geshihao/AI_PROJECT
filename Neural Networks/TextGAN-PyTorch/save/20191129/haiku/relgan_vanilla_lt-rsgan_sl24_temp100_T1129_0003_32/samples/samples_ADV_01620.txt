darkening trees + few of old tears + and her thoughts + summer rain
summit cairn + the damp scent of + eucalyptus
chrysanthamums + no more + inside the bottle ’ s end + too much stars
the name + of an old barn -- - + a pregnant woman in
spring mist + the little twilight + finally it rains 's feet + in the bird trees
into dusk + the only window + for the moon of my eye + of her needle '
the glare off snow + between the leaves + the old pond
in the headlights + three boys + and a rain + at the funeral
a dried mouth + no heat no food -- + my coffee grows cold
january in the clouds + my air conditioner + sweating
candle drippings + on the branch i + new moon
almost dawn + of the returning geese + the last late evenings
crowded subway -- + the drunk offers me his seat + for the red wine
bamboo depths . . + a carp circles + your smile
chilled by spring winds + schoolgirls sniffing body spray + behind the gym
high winds + the tea leaves + with the silver tin rain + so much louder
early spring + everything + dripping from the mirror + a winter berries
frosty night . . . + a new twist + between the song
questions + purl like schools of fish + from dangerous waters
all day ... + i trace my toe in sand + and morning
spring fever + the mixed calls + of courting in the darkness
slice by slice + the pie disappears— + blueberry stains
dance of the rain + mum 's tombstone + so cold night
along the pavement + snatches of the same + frost appears
darkened church -- + a brightness to find + what might have been lost
leaves train -- + to the autumn + sunshine the birthday
just friends — + a taste of summer + slowly my
a sudden chill -- + a wave of cirrus clouds breaks + in the spider web
reoccurrence + of suburban + on the salt fallen branch + dream so stars
arizona + road stop rest , + on the same green
indian summer + a yellowed postcard + falls on the stone buddha 's eve
the crowd + holding blossoms . . . + thunder !
