my daughter starts college - + in the friend + takes my darkness
grey morning + firecracker papers + wander the streets
to paint around + a reek of cheap fat + lingers
prayer lamp - + something of me + on the moth 's end
other species + the scarecrow 's coat sleeve + caught in mid-wave
a whiff + of a gull + far grow + in the autumn rain deepens
early spring + everything + dripping
wedding anniversary + does he still love + winter rain
empty bus stop -- + homeless man + in the wind
indian summer + turkey feather falling + to cold reach
rice-green pond -- + koi swim + through the same fog + aroma of the lot
new year + fireworks + in the misty moon + for no lipstick
hunter days + turquoise deepens + on the salt air
valentine 's day -- - + recycling + old gold
summer evening - + oak branches fracture + a falling 's cry
almost dawn -- + a second cup + of bad coffee
roadside puddle + a pale moon + reveals the pine
haiku potato chips + nobody can write + just one
the old garden + amongst cedar trees + too slow to the end + a glimmer of light
arizona + road stop rest , + highway or
an orange and pink sky . . . + a last drops in the city + summer night
backfire— + the persistent taps + of old ear
alone + blowing dandelions + on the map -- + an apple
hearing the call for prayer + as i pass her + bus forty one
i saw her nape + beads of + and morning snow
removing her wedding ring + she brushes ¡t along + her husband husband 's sonogram 's trombone + scent of jasmine
spring gale -- + someone + one last night
spring breeze -- + even the stones + in unfamiliar colors
rain-laden cedars + my skin feels so moist today + scent of yellow rose
her 18th birthday— + watching the grass the + first frost
awakened + by moonlight + an old regret
from under the day + with a text + april rain
